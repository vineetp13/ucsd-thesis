\chapter{Conclusion}
%"build theory, think expansively, and tackle broader conceptual issues, not (primarily) to reiterate the literal outcomes of your work.”-srk


\section{Shortcomings / Challenges / limitations}
%"What were the challenges of this work? For example, the difficulty of gathering longitudinal data b/c people are tied to their email client. How would you recommend others address these challenges?" - srk
Is this really scientific work though? To be able to publish in a top-tier journal and to inform policy, the experiments would need to satisfy domain-specific rules. This would inform more specific rules around manipulation (rather than self-adminstering the intervention), use of placebo, and so on. We also find these to be useful avenues for further social computing use: enabling family members to administer the intervention based on reminders, or even enabling them to randomize that order... 
	Also minimal pairs and double blind -- how would you implement it socially without bias -- this trade-off between social trust and bias can be interesting -- wll it be like x or like y

\section{Implications - 0folk theories and learning interfaces}
%"If the world were to transform to rely heavily on your work, what broader technical and societal transformations would arise? How would your work scale? What would the social and technical challenges be? This might be a good place to connect your work to broader (relevant) writing on the role of technology in society"-srk

\section{Systems/domains: 4 Complex Work} 
%\section{New Systems? Other areas of application?}
% "where else could your techniques and insights apply? Think big."-srk
% fig: a set that shows many approaches for generating hypotheses and evaluating theories
%-- and says these systems are all waiting to be built

\section{Patterns} 
%"What are the research issues for advancing and crystallizing patterns in this area?" - srk
%     see email threads with tricia

\section{Methods: Section 3 - how to do this} 
%"Reflecting on the methods you employed – system building, studies, etc. What worked best? What effort was wasted? What things would you do differently? And what would you recommend (or not) to others? (This might go adjacent challenges.)" - srk

\section{Behavior} 
%"what do you want to know about human behavior? For example, we know that most behavioral interventions (like exercising more) are tough to stick. Speculate beyond your data about behavior. Generalize. Make wild guesses. And think about what next steps would help you get to those." - srk
