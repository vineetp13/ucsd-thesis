%"build theory, think expansively, and tackle broader conceptual issues, not (primarily) to reiterate the literal outcomes of your work.”-srk
Drawing from empirical results, related work, and the lessons from desinging these systems, this chapter provides future steps along three themes: 1) building future system contributions, 2) identifying open questions for theoretical contributions, and 3) thinking through broader implications for computation in society.

Domain experts make creative contributions like writing articles, curating museums, leading teams, and more. How might we enable a federation of novices to perform these activities? This dissertation demonstrates that procedural guidance works well for scientific experimentation. How might we develop techniques to conceptually divide other scientific activities into small-but-significant tasks that people can perform? Useful techniques for just-in-time expertise include learning, community inputs, automation, and expert help. Futhermore, which other genre of work and levels of contribution could this extend to? As in science, the number of experts in many domains is relatively small and their training relatively homogenous.

%\subsection{Other domains that might benefit from procedural guidance}
\subsection{Deeper work: End to end scientific work}
%Social computing environments that model richer work in more domains using procedural support and roles
Scientific experimentation forms a critical component of scientific work across many domains in the natural and behavioral science. Experimentation provides one method of enquiry; other ways to test hypotheses include conducting surveys, observational studies, and more. Furthermore, \textit{scientists} perform a range of activities including: 1) data analysis, and 2) comunicating the results (e.g. by writing a paper). One key challenge in such complex work is coming up with the initial design(s) that can be refined. This dissertation demonstrates that procedural guidance enables people to transform an intuition to a structurally-sound experiment design.
%Starting with being able to understand and reason about the choices, there are many concrete activities that

One popular process for writing includes creating an outline, converting the outline to a draft, and editing the draft. Past research systems (like soylent) have supported people in editing papers. However, few tools support creating the outline and the first draft, arguably an onerous task. Research journals and conferences provide templates for formatting guidelines, but the argument and the authors need to generate the content and the argument. EteRNA participants used system-provided templates to write up their results and share with others. How might procedural systems assist?

%multiple sources: experienced campaigners’ minds, books/tutorials, and internet posts. 
As is common for complex work, insights to write are distributed across people, static documents, and online resources. Experienced campaigners know the success criteria, mental scaffolds to help with writing, and access to other people to invite feedback on their work. Novices lack all these. Explicating experts' tacit knowledge and showing them to novices in the context of the work can be useful. To demonstrate the variance in the scientific writing process, let’s consider two contrasting examples: the methods section and the discussion section.

The methods section follows standard guidelines and many expert writers might find this to be easy to write up. However, writing the methods section is not straightforward for novices. The method section describes the study hypotheses, choices of measures and method of enquiry, and all relevant decisions taken while running the study. Furthermore, these details need to be mentioned in standard ways so others can understand and recreate these instructions. A procedural guidance system can rely heavily on templates in this case to ensure that novices don't commit standard \textit{mistakes}. The key insight here is for the system to support people in exploting the rather specific structure of the methods section.

The discussion section is far less templated though. The discussion section needs to bring together the ideas presented in the paper, the methods, and the results. In doing so, the discussion section needs to link ideas from multiple sections of the paper: claims about the novelty of the work, ways in which this work extends current enquiry, the actual results and how they deviate from the expected results, and the new questions created by this enquiry. A procedural guidance system for writing the discussion section can use multiple techniques; it can 1) identify the research question; 2) use rubrics to prompt the writer to reflect on their claims; 3) show examples from other discussion sections to show how to write specific portions; and 4) use checklists and peer feedback to improve clarity. The key insight here would be to help people explore all the options or questions to answer in the discussion section.

Such suggestions are preliminary; this dissertation's experience strongly suggests rapid iterations using pilots to understand the success and failure of different techniques. 
%The difference between domains differences too and it becomes interesting to note how this might shake out — that is what makes this research exciting.

\subsection{More domains for citizen-led scientific investigations}
This research used microbiome research as a petri dish because it’s nascent, personal, and motivating. Other domains that meet these criteria can be useful domains of enquiry as well. E.g., going by the absence of enough research in cultural psychology, that provides one arena. Other health related fields with devoted communites are a good match — nutrition, brain zapping, and more. All of these fields will have their prompts of doing research and that needs to be baked in to the system along with rules of harm and gain etc..  e.g. while tdcs folks are interested in testing whether brain zapping improves cognitive gains and use standard metrics, implementing them the way researchers do it might be useful too.

Thinking more broadly, scientific work is not the only domain of application for this work — art (crowd art) can also learn from procedural rules [jennifer jacobs procedural art work] because it shares three features with our work: xx, yy, and zz.There are limits too: 1) when people do not have relevant expertise or when teaching them takes a lot of effort — consider journalism; 2)  when people don’t stand to gain?; 3)  when different people don’t bring in different expertise

\subsection{Designing efficient procedural support}
%highlight open questions?

This dissertation'''s theme of providing procedural support is not too far from computational thinking and the phases it contains: abstraction, decomposition, generalization, and pattern matching. The key difference is that part of the work happens  by the designer (abstraction), the system (decomposition) and part with people (generalization and pattern matching).The trouble with computer procedures is that are interpreted literally — people are wiser. Think of procedures as computing does — except that these are interpreted by people.

\subsubsection{Integrating procedural support for your task}
%this heading is kinda useless
Based on this dissertation's struggles and results, we see the following process for how to integrate procedural guidance. 

% (add figure)
\begin{itemize}
\item Examples, checklists, and templates provide procedural support: Procedural guidance works well when the sub-examples provide a direct link to the overall picture (e.g. hypo vs exp design).  Multimodal interactions for one or more of these can be useful too: e.g. people could see JIT videos of experts' work to draw inspiration rather than just looking at a final output. A key responsibility of the system is to handle the interaction between subparts or  provide examples of the sufficient abstraction; tackling all cases might be difficult. Dividing a complex artifact into specific subparts is difficult and requires starting from "good enough" places rather than providing perfect examples etc. The challenge is also of correctness: how do you teach complex ideas without making them wrong. Choosing appropriate examples etc is important.
\item People identify: People are good at identifying than generating [?? analogical thinking]. With procedural support, people aren’t blind users of the system but they actively translate what’s provided to them and do it back. Consequently, the support needs to be simple enough for the users to understand -- for novices, this might mean using simpler terminology. 
\item People transfer these ideas to their work/domain: To make the links concrete, the examples should be specific. To reduce the load of transfering the ideas, the support should be provided in-situ. Consequently, people will struggle when understanding procedural support itself takes effort or when the examples/checklists are too big or when this still requires expertise. 
\item Reviews from others: This should be complementary to the designer's work.
\end{itemize}

%link these to the topics discussed above
Another conceptual question is understanding the limits to procedural work. Based on procedural support as described above, it has limitations as well. This approach will struggle when when the concept being studied requires global awareness which is a hallmark of complex work: the sum is greater than the parts.  While procedural support can scale well, it might struggle for too “out there” ideas.

It's also important to not all complex work have this breakdown. For instance, consider collective activism. — there’s no set way to do this. How will the roles and procedural support look like for activities that do not have templated format like between-subjects scientific experimentation?  what happens when software does not have a strong model of the domain or a "high-level" recipe that can be improved.

%From Data to knowledge to wisdom
This dissertation research provides a vision and prototype systems for complex work by drawing on insights from interactive systems, social computing, and learning theory  for enabling people to perform personally meaningful work. By doing so, this thesis intends to democratize expertise and provide ways to meaningfully embed computation in society.
