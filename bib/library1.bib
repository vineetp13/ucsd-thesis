@article{VanderMeij1995,
abstract = {[The minimalist approach that we advocate has received widespread attention as a better way to develop training and information (e.g., manuals, online support). Empirical studies support its claims of effectiveness, but they also point out that practitioners find it hard to develop minimalist instruction because of a lack of specific guidelines. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive overview of the principles and heuristics that can be used to create minimalist instruction. These principles and heuristics are illustrated by examples from various task domains and for different kinds of supports. In many cases, they are accompanied by a theoretical rationale or some empirical background information. The principles and heuristics are presented not as rules to be followed strictly, but as suggestions on how to create minimalist instruction in different contexts and for different audiences, applications, and purposes.]},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing is growing rapidly in both industry and academia, introducing new ways of conducting work and improving our understanding of how to utilize the potential of crowds. Related research has emphasized on how to improve crowdsourcing platforms and related practices to foster collaboration, motivation, trust, quality and creativity. However, these challenges do not seem to be as apparent in vibrant online communities. Research in how to make online communities work provides insights into how to address the challenges crowdsourcing is facing right now. For this work, we have gathered from literature relevant design guidelines (heuristics) for online communities and have applied them to 20 crowdsourcing platforms to evaluate how those platforms conform to the heuristics. The heuristics can be used as a tool for designers of crowdsourcing platforms, to evaluate how to improve these platforms and to compare them to their competition. Finally, our paper highlights the current challenges crowdsourcing platforms face to acquire positive aspects of online communities.},

abstract = {Socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in health care quality have
been extensively documented. Recently, the elimination of disparities in health
care has become the focus of a national initiative. Yet, there is little effort
to monitor and address disparities in health care through organizational quality
improvement. After reviewing literature on disparities in health care, we
discuss the limitations in existing quality assessment for identifying and
addressing these disparities. We propose 5 principles to address these disparities
through modifications in quality performance measures: disparities represent
a significant quality problem; current data collection efforts are inadequate
to identify and address disparities; clinical performance measures should
be stratified by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position for public reporting;
population-wide monitoring should incorporate adjustment for race/ethnicity
and socioeconomic position; and strategies to adjust payment for race/ethnicity
and socioeconomic position should be considered to reflect the known effects
of both on morbidity.},

@article{Schwartz1998,
abstract = {In this article, the authors describe research about a method for developing prior knowledge that prepares students to learn from a text or lecture. They propose that analyzing contrasting cases can help learners generate the differentiated knowledge structures that enable them to understand a text deeply. In 3 classroom studies, college students analyzed contrasting cases that consisted of simplified experimental designs and data from classic psychology experiments. They then received a lecture or text on the psychological phenomena highlighted in the experiments. Approximately 1 wk later, they predicted outcomes for a hypothetical experiment that could be interpreted in light of the concepts they had studied. Generating the distinctions between contrasting cases and then reading a text or hearing a lecture led to more accurate predictions than the control treatments of (1) reading about the distinctions between the cases and hearing a lecture, (2) summarizing a relevant text and hearing a lecture, and (3) analyzing the contrasting cases twice without a lecture. Results indicate that there is a place for lectures and reading in the classroom if students have sufficiently differentiated domain knowledge to use the expository materials in a generative manner.

abstract = {Context: The N-of-1 trial design (randomized and blinded single-patient trials) has been popular abroad for 25 years or more. Many papers using the N-of-1 trials have been published in international medical journals.However, little is known about this methodology in China. Our purpose is to describe the current status of N-of-1 trials in China, to explain why they have not been more widely used, and to suggest a roadmap for the development of N-of-1 trials, especially for the study of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Methods: An electronic search was conducted using the Chinese Biological Medicine Database (CBM) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) with the keywords " N-of-1 trial, single case OR individual patient AND randomized" We also searched PubMed. The Chinese Science Citation Database (CSCD) as a citation was searched at last. Results: 23 studies were retrieved from CBM and 34 from CNKI. There were 13 papers about N-of-1 trials in CBM and 17 in CNKI. Only 3 studies were rigorously designed (i.e., using randomization, control periods and blinding). The other 8 papers were descriptive and review articles, most of which were in TCM. One review was published in SCI-E and one in MEDLINE. Three papers were found in CSCD as citations. Only one of the retrieved studies was funded. Conclusions: While N-of-1 trials may offer a good tool to individualize clinical care and enrich TCM clinical research, they have not been widely used to date. To spur the development of this method, we would like to suggest three points. First, the Chinese government should endorse and sponsor N-of-1 studies. Second, researchers and physicians should be systematically trained in the method. Third, thorough considerations on trials allow better research and focus on the patients' needs. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Collecting (or "sampling") information that one expects to be useful is a powerful way to facilitate learning. However, relatively little is known about how people decide which information is worth sampling over the course of learning. We describe several alternative models of how people might decide to collect a piece of information inspired by "active learning" research in machine learning. We additionally provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the situations under which these models are empirically distinguishable, and we report a novel empirical study that exploits these insights. Our model-based analysis of participants' information gathering decisions reveals that people prefer to select items which resolve uncertainty between two possibilities at a time rather than items that have high uncertainty across all relevant possibilities simultaneously. Rather than adhering to strictly normative or confirmatory conceptions of information search, people appear to prefer a "local" sampling strategy, which may reflect cognitive constraints on the process of information gathering.},

Diabetes Alert Dogs are trained to detect the onset of an attack before the condition of the human handler they are paired with deteriorates, giving them time to take action. We investigated requirements for designing an alarm system allowing dogs to remotely call for help when their human falls unconscious before being able to react to an alert. Through a multispecies ethnographic approach we focus on the requirements for a physical canine user interface, involving dogs, their handlers and specialist dog trainers in the design process. We discuss tensions between the requirements for canine and the human users, argue the need for increased sensitivity towards the needs of individual dogs that goes beyond breed specific physical characteristics, and reflect on how we can move from designing for dogs to designing with dogs.},

abstract = {People in human-computer interaction have learned a great deal about how to persuade and influence users of computing technology. They have much less well-founded knowledge about how to help users choose for themselves. It's time to correct this imbalance. A first step is to organize the vast amount of relevant knowledge that has been built up in psychology and related fields in terms of two comprehensive but easy-to-remember models: The Aspect model answers the question "How do people make choices?" by describing six choice patterns that choosers apply alternately or in combination, based on Attributes, Social influence, Policies, Experience, Consequences, and Trial and error. The Arcade model answers the question "How can we help people make better choices?" by describing six general high-level strategies for supporting choice: Access information and experience, Represent the choice situation, Combine and compute, Advise about processing, Design the domain, and Evaluate on behalf of the chooser. These strategies can be implemented with straightforward interaction design, but for each one there are also specifically relevant technologies. Combining these two models, we can understand virtually all existing and possible approaches to choice support as the application of one or more of the Arcade strategies to one or more of the Aspect choice patterns. After introducing the idea of choice architecture for humancomputer interaction and the key ideas of the Aspect and Arcade models, we discuss each of the Aspect patterns in detail and show how the high-level Arcade strategies can be applied to it to yield specific tactics. We then apply the two models in the domains of online communities and privacy. Most of our examples concern choices about the use of computing technology, but the models are equally applicable to everyday choices made with the help of computing technology.},

We found that asking increases tags provided overall, though asking generally decreases the provision of unprompted tags. Users were more likely to comply with our request when we asked them to tag obscure movies and when we sued reciprocal request rhetoric.},

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted two years running at the Consumer Electronics Show and its Digital Health Summit, this article explores the vision of technologically assisted self-regulation that drives the design of wearable tracking technology. As key artifacts in a new cultural convergence of sensor technology and self-care that I call “data for life,” wearables are marketed as digital compasses whose continuous tracking capacities and big-data analytics can help consumers navigate the field of everyday choice making and better control how their bites, sips, steps, and minutes of sleep add up to affect their health. By offering consumers a way to simultaneously embrace and outsource the task of lifestyle management, I argue, such products at once exemplify and short-circuit cultural ideals for individual responsibility and self-regulation.},

abstract = {AbstractThis study examined the relationship among declarative, conceptual, and procedural knowledge in the acquisition of ruler measurement skills. Sixth-grade industrial arts students were taught how to use a ruler with one of two instructional methods; the fractional method was based on an understanding of fractions, whereas the line identification method required no understanding of fractions. Results indicated that the line identification method was superior overall to the fractional method, both for the initial acquisition as well as retention of skills. This superiority occurred for questions measuring understanding of fractions but not for ruler skills, indicating that students were able to use procedural knowledge to infer conceptual knowledge. Results are discussed in terms of several models of learning that address how declarative, conceptual, and procedural knowledge interact in the learning process.},

abstract = {Background: In recent years, people who sought direct-to-consumer genetic testing services have been increasingly confronted with an unprecedented amount of personal genomic information, which influences their decisions, emotional state, and well-being. However, these users of direct-to-consumer genetic services, who vary in their education and interests, frequently have little relevant experience or tools for understanding, reasoning about, and interacting with their personal genomic data. Online interactive techniques can play a central role in making personal genomic data useful for these users. Objective: We sought to (1) identify the needs of diverse users as they make sense of their personal genomic data, (2) consequently develop effective interactive visualizations of genomic trait data to address these users? needs, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of the developed visualizations in facilitating comprehension. Methods: The first two user studies, conducted with 63 volunteers in the Personal Genome Project and with 36 personal genomic users who participated in a design workshop, respectively, employed surveys and interviews to identify the needs and expectations of diverse users. Building on the two initial studies, the third study was conducted with 730 Amazon Mechanical Turk users and employed a controlled experimental design to examine the effectiveness of different design interventions on user comprehension. Results: The first two studies identified searching, comparing, sharing, and organizing data as fundamental to users? understanding of personal genomic data. The third study demonstrated that interactive and visual design interventions could improve the understandability of personal genomic reports for consumers. In particular, results showed that a new interactive bubble chart visualization designed for the study resulted in the highest comprehension scores, as well as the highest perceived comprehension scores. These scores were significantly higher than scores received using the industry standard tabular reports currently used for communicating personal genomic information. Conclusions: Drawing on multiple research methods and populations, the findings of the studies reported in this paper offer deep understanding of users? needs and practices, and demonstrate that interactive online design interventions can improve the understandability of personal genomic reports for consumers. We discuss implications for designers and researchers.},

Jure Leskovec and colleagues analysed smartphone sensor-based activity patterns from over 600,000 people in 46 countries. They find a large range of distributions of activity levels across populations, which are primarily driven by the activity level of women. The inequality between the least and most active segments of populations is more predictive of obesity prevalence in each population than the mean activity levels. Additionally, inequality is reduced in the more walkable cities where the greatest gains in activity are observed in females. These findings suggest the potential benefits of focusing urban planning and public health policy on increasing activity on the most activity-poor subgroups.},

@article{Rittle-Johnson1999,
abstract = {This study examined relations between children's conceptual understanding of mathematical equivalence and their procedures for solving equivalence problems (e.g., 3 + 4 + 5 = 3 +). Students in 4th and 5th grades completed assessments of their conceptual and procedural knowledge of equivalence, both before and after a brief lesson. The instruction focused either on the concept of equivalence or on a correct procedure for solving equivalence problems. Conceptual instruction led to increased conceptual understanding and to generation and transfer of a correct procedure. Procedural instruction led to increased conceptual understanding and to adoption, but only limited transfer, of the instructed procedure. These findings highlight the causal relations between conceptual and procedural knowledge and suggest that conceptual knowledge may have a greater influence on procedural knowledge than the reverse. In many domains, children must learn both fundamental concepts and correct procedures for solving problems. For example, mathematical competence rests on children devel-oping and connecting their knowledge of concepts and procedures. However, the developmental relations between conceptual and procedural knowledge are not well-under-stood (Hiebert {\&} Wearne, 1986; Rittle-Johnson {\&} Siegler, in press). Delineating how the two forms of knowledge interact is fundamental to understanding how learning occurs. This issue is of practical, as well as theoretical, impor-tance. The widespread observation that many children perform poorly in school mathematics highlights the need for improved instruction. Educators and policy makers are placing increased emphasis on teaching the conceptual basis for problem-solving procedures (National Council of Teach-ers of Mathematics [NCTM], 1989), in hopes that increasing conceptual understanding will lead to improved problem-solving performance. To design effective instruction, one must carefully delineate key mathematical concepts and their associated procedures, identify what children at various},

While many existing VQSs promise to accelerate exploratory data analysis by facilitating this search, they are unfortunately not widely used in practice. Through a year-long collaboration with scientists in three distinct domains---astronomy, genetics, and material science---we study the impact of various features within VQSs that can aid rapid visual data analysis, and how VQSs fit into a scientists' analysis workflow. Our findings offer design guidelines for improving the usability and adoption of next-generation VQSs, paving the way for VQSs to be applied to a variety of scientific domains.},

First, it can expedite digital health intervention development, improving efficacy, and increasing reach. Second, moving behavioral health interventions to digital platforms presents researchers with novel (potentially paradigm shifting) opportunities for advancing theories and techniques. In particular, the potential for technology to revolutionize theory refinement is made possible by leveraging the proliferation of "real-time" objective measurement and "big data" commonly generated and stored by digital platforms. Much more could be done to realize this potential. This paper offers proposals for better leveraging the potential advantages of digital health platforms, and reviews three of the cutting edge methods for doing so: optimization designs, dynamic systems modeling, and social network analysis.;},

To build such systems, we must identify the fashion activities that are the largest consumer pain points, the interventions necessary to alleviate those pains, and the computational models that enable those interventions. To guide the design of these next-generation tools, we propose an experimentation engine for fashion interfaces: leveraging social media platforms to run multivariate design tests with thousands to millions of users. Social platforms are already home to dedicated communities of fashion enthusiasts, and expose programmable agents - chatbots - that can be used to rapidly prototype data-driven design interfaces. Measuring the number of followers and user engagement amongst these prototypes can inform the design of future standalone fashion systems.

Microbial genome sequencing is now being routinely used in many clinical and public health laboratories. Understanding how to report complex genomic test results to stakeholders who may have varying familiarity with genomics—including clinicians, laboratorians, epidemiologists, and researchers—is critical to the successful and sustainable implementation of this new technology; however, there are no evidence-based guidelines for designing such a report in the pathogen genomics domain. Here, we describe an iterative, human-centered approach to creating a report template for communicating tuberculosis (TB) genomic test results.

Methods
We used Design Study Methodology—a human centered approach drawn from the information visualization domain—to redesign an existing clinical report. We used expert consults and an online questionnaire to discover various stakeholders' needs around the types of data and tasks related to TB that they encounter in their daily workflow. We also evaluated their perceptions of and familiarity with genomic data, as well as its utility at various clinical decision points. These data shaped the design of multiple prototype reports that were compared against the existing report through a second online survey, with the resulting qualitative and quantitative data informing the final, redesigned, report.

Results
We recruited 78 participants, 65 of whom were clinicians, nurses, laboratorians, researchers, and epidemiologists involved in TB diagnosis, treatment, and/or surveillance. Our first survey indicated that participants were largely enthusiastic about genomic data, with the majority agreeing on its utility for certain TB diagnosis and treatment tasks and many reporting some confidence in their ability to interpret this type of data (between 58.8{\%} and 94.1{\%}, depending on the specific data type). When we compared our four prototype reports against the existing design, we found that for the majority (86.7{\%}) of design comparisons, participants preferred the alternative prototype designs over the existing version, and that both clinicians and non-clinicians expressed similar design preferences. Participants showed clearer design preferences when asked to compare individual design elements versus entire reports. Both the quantitative and qualitative data informed the design of a revised report, available online as a LaTeX template.

Conclusions
We show how a human-centered design approach integrating quantitative and qualitative feedback can be used to design an alternative report for representing complex microbial genomic data. We suggest experimental and design guidelines to inform future design studies in the bioinformatics and microbial genomics domains, and suggest that this type of mixed-methods study is important to facilitate the successful translation of pathogen genomics in the clinic, not only for clinical reports but also more complex bioinformatics data visualization software.},

abstract = {MoClo Planner is an interactive visualization system for collaborative bio-design, utilizing a multi-touch interactive surface. The system integrates the information gathering, design, and specification of complex synthetic biological constructs using the Modular Cloning (MoClo) assembly method. Modular Cloning is a hierarchical DNA construction method that allows for the assembly of multi-part constructs from a library of biological parts in a one-pot reaction. This cutting-edge method facilitates and expedites the assembly of complex biological designs. However, it is an intricate multi-step process, which to date, has not been adequately supported by existing bio-design tools. Novel visual tools are needed in order to make MoClo more tractable and accessible to a broad range of users, to facilitate a less error prone bio-design process, and to improve workflow. MoClo Planner is a result of a participatory and user-centered design process, which included close collaboration with domain experts. Using multi-touch interactions and a rich graphical interface, the system accelerates the MoClo learning process, and reduces design time and errors. In this paper, we present user requirements and describe the design, implementation, and evaluation of MoClo Planner.},

abstract = {Tangible user interfaces (tuis) augment the physical world by integrating digital information with everyday physical objects. Developing tangible interfaces is problematic because programmers are responsible for acquiring and abstracting physical input. This is difficult, time-consuming, and requires a high level of technical expertise in fields very different from user interface development — especially in the case of computer vision. Consequently, only a small cadre of technology experts can currently build these uis. Based on a literature review and structured interviews with tui researchers, we created Papier-M{\^{a}}ch{\'{e}}, a toolkit for building tangible interfaces using computer vision, electronic tags, and barcodes. Papier- M{\^{a}}ch{\'{e}} introduces high-level abstractions for working with these input technologies that facilitates technology portability. We evaluated this toolkit through a laboratory study and longitudinal use in course and research projects, finding the input abstractions, technology portability, and monitoring facilities to be highly effective. This dissertation contributes new software tools and interaction techniques for tangible user interface input. It comprises Papier-M{\^{a}}ch{\'{e}}, a toolkit for building tangible uis; Books with Voices, a system providing barcode-augmented paper transcripts for random access to digital video; and The Designers' Outpost, a tangible ui for collaborative web site design. Papier-M{\^{a}}ch{\'{e}}'s design has been deeply influenced by my experiences building physical interfaces. Web designers use pens, paper, walls, and tables for explaining, developing, and communicating ideas during the early phases of design. These practices inspired The Designers' Outpost. With Outpost, users collaboratively author web site information architectures on an electronic whiteboard using physical media (Post-it notes and images), structuring and annotating that information with electronic pens. This interaction is enabled by a touch-sensitive electronic whiteboard augmented with a computer vision system. We conducted several studies of this system that validated that Outpost supports information architecture work practice and led us to develop support for design history, remote collabora- tion, and fluid interoperability with other design tools. The second major tui we developed focused on oral historians. While oral historians consider interview recordings a central historical artifact, these recordings sit unused after a written transcript is produced. We hypothesized that this is largely because books are more usable than recordings. Therefore, we created Books with Voices: barcode-augmented paper transcripts enabling fast, random access to digital video interviews on a pda. Our evaluation found this lightweight, structured access to original recordings to offer substantial benefits with minimal overhead. Both The Designers' Outpost and Books with Voices could have been built in a fraction of the time if the Papier-M{\^{a}}ch{\'{e}} toolkit had been available.},

As a result, the nascent fields of mHealth and digital medicine have gained traction over the past decade as demonstrated in the United States by increased federal funding for research that cuts across a broad spectrum of health conditions. The existence of mHealth and digital medicine also introduced new ethical and regulatory challenges that both institutional review boards (IRBs) and researchers are struggling to navigate. In response, the Connected and Open Research Ethics (CORE) initiative was launched. The CORE initiative has employed a participatory research approach, whereby researchers and IRB affiliates are involved in identifying the priorities and functionality of a shared resource. The overarching goal of CORE is to develop dynamic and relevant ethical practices to guide mHealth and digital medicine research. In this Viewpoint paper, we describe the CORE initiative and call for readers to join the CORE Network and contribute to the bigger conversation on ethics in the digital age.},

Yet many of these technologies focus on such pragmatic issues as collecting and presenting health information and modifying individuals' behavior. At the same time, researchers in clinical community argue that individuals' perception of their identity has dramatic consequences for their health behaviors. In this paper we discuss results of a deployment study of a mobile health monitoring application. We show how individuals with considerable diabetes experience found a unique way to adopt this health-monitoring application to construct and negotiate their identities as persons with a chronic disease. We argue that viewing health management from identity construction perspective opens new opportunities for research and design in technologies for health.},

The findings suggest that individuals generate and evaluate hypotheses regarding health implications of their actions. Thus, health-monitoring applications can assist individuals in making educated choices by facilitating discovery of correlations between their past actions and health states. Deployment of an early prototype of a health-monitoring application demonstrated the need for careful presentation techniques to promote more robust understanding and to avoid reinforcement of biases.},

abstract = {Type 2 diabetes leads to premature death and reduced quality of life for 8{\%} of Americans. Nutrition management is critical to maintaining glycemic control, yet it is difficult to achieve due to the high individual differences in glycemic response to nutrition. Anticipating glycemic impact of different meals can be challenging not only for individuals with diabetes, but also for expert diabetes educators. Personalized computational models that can accurately forecast an impact of a given meal on an individual's blood glucose levels can serve as the engine for a new generation of decision support tools for individuals with diabetes. However, to be useful in practice, these computational engines need to generate accurate forecasts based on limited datasets consistent with typical self-monitoring practices of individuals with type 2 diabetes. This paper uses three forecasting machines: (i) data assimilation, a technique borrowed from atmospheric physics and engineering that uses Bayesian modeling to infuse data with human knowledge represented in a mechanistic model, to generate real-time, personalized, adaptable glucose forecasts; (ii) model averaging of data assimilation output; and (iii) dynamical Gaussian process model regression. The proposed data assimilation machine, the primary focus of the paper, uses a modified dual unscented Kalman filter to estimate states and parameters, personalizing the mechanistic models. Model selection is used to make a personalized model selection for the individual and their measurement characteristics. The data assimilation forecasts are empirically evaluated against actual postprandial glucose measurements captured by individuals with type 2 diabetes, and against predictions generated by experienced diabetes educators after reviewing a set of historical nutritional records and glucose measurements for the same individual. The evaluation suggests that the data assimilation forecasts compare well with specific glucose measurements and match or exceed in accuracy expert forecasts. We conclude by examining ways to present predictions as forecast-derived range quantities and evaluate the comparative advantages of these ranges.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate subjective experiences and patterns of engagement with a novel electronic tool for facilitating reflection and problem solving for individuals with type 2 diabetes, Mobile Diabetes Detective (MoDD). METHODS: In this qualitative study, researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with individuals from economically disadvantaged communities and ethnic minorities who are participating in a randomized controlled trial of MoDD. The transcripts of the interviews were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis; usage logs were analyzed to determine how actively the study participants used MoDD. RESULTS: Fifteen participants in the MoDD randomized controlled trial were recruited for the qualitative interviews. Usage log analysis showed that, on average, during the 4 weeks of the study, the study participants logged into MoDD twice per week, reported 120 blood glucose readings, and set two behavioral goals. The qualitative interviews suggested that individuals used MoDD to follow the steps of the problem-solving process, from identifying problematic blood glucose patterns, to exploring behavioral triggers contributing to these patterns, to selecting alternative behaviors, to implementing these behaviors while monitoring for improvements in glycemic control. DISCUSSION: This qualitative study suggested that informatics interventions for reflection and problem solving can provide structured scaffolding for facilitating these processes by guiding users through the different steps of the problem-solving process and by providing them with context-sensitive evidence and practice-based knowledge related to diabetes self-management on each of those steps. CONCLUSION: This qualitative study suggested that MoDD was perceived as a useful tool in engaging individuals in self-monitoring, reflection, and problem solving.},

We subtly exposed participants to feedback that they perceived to be provided by people 'like them', and experimentally controlled the tone and content of the feedback to provide either positive, negative, or no social proof. We then measured how participants' quanti-tative and qualitative evaluations of an HCI artifact changed based on the feedback to which they were exposed. We con-ducted two controlled experiments: an online experiment with 245 MTurk workers and a field experiment with 63 women in rural India. Our findings reveal significant differences be-tween participants in the positive, negative, and no social proof conditions, both online and in the field. Participants in the neg-ative condition provided lower ratings and a greater amount of critical feedback, while participants in the positive condi-tion provided higher ratings and a greater amount of positive feedback. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that social proof is a practical and generalizable technique that could be used by HCI researchers to influence participant response bias in a wide range of contexts and domains.},

abstract = {Data-driven decision-making consequential to individuals raises important questions of accountability and justice. Indeed, European law provides individuals limited rights to 'meaningful information about the logic' behind significant, autonomous decisions such as loan approvals, insurance quotes, and CV filtering. We undertake three experimental studies examining people's perceptions of justice in algorithmic decision-making under different scenarios and explanation styles. Dimensions of justice previously observed in response to human decision-making appear similarly engaged in response to algorithmic decisions. Qualitative analysis identified several concerns and heuristics involved in justice perceptions including arbitrariness, generalisation, and (in)dignity. Quantitative analysis indicates that explanation styles primarily matter to justice perceptions only when subjects are exposed to multiple different styles---under repeated exposure of one style, scenario effects obscure any explanation effects. Our results suggests there may be no 'best' approach to explaining algorithmic decisions, and that reflection on their automated nature both implicates and mitigates justice dimensions.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing systems accomplish large tasks with scale and speed by breaking work down into independent parts. However, many types of complex creative work, such as fiction writing, have remained out of reach for crowds because work is tightly interdependent: changing one part of a story may trigger changes to the overall plot and vice versa. Taking inspiration from how expert authors write, we propose a technique for achieving interdependent complex goals with crowds. With this technique, the crowd loops between reflection, to select a high-level goal, and revision, to decompose that goal into low-level, actionable tasks. We embody this approach in Mechanical Novel, a system that crowdsources short fiction stories on Amazon Mechanical Turk. In a field experiment, Mechanical Novel resulted in higher-quality stories than an iterative crowdsourcing workflow. Our findings suggest that orienting crowd work around high-level goals may enable workers to coordinate their effort to accomplish complex work.},

We propose an online creative community where sharing process, rather than showcasing outcomes, is the main method of sharing creative work. Based on this, we present Mosaic-an online community where illustrators share workin-progress snapshots showing how an artwork was completed from start to finish. In an online deployment and observational study, artists used Mosaic as a vehicle for reflecting on how they can improve their own creative process, developed a social norm of detailed feedback, and became less apprehensive of sharing early versions of artwork. Through Mosaic, we argue that communities oriented around sharing creative process can create a collaborative environment that is beneficial for creative growth.},

abstract = {Following the widespread adoption of new approaches to the combination of experimental uncertainties, two theories of error are identified and their possible justifications assessed. They are the "orthodox theory" based on the familiar distinction between random and systematic errors and the "randomatic theory" which dispenses with the distinction and treats all errors as the orthodox theory treats random errors. The orthodox theory suffers from a number of important confusions about the nature of its central distinction, about the combination of uncertainties, and about which populations of results can correctly be said to contain random errors. These confusions are clarified and the central distinction is argued to be objective. Three justifications are developed for the randomatic theory: 1) that it is implied by the generally accepted law of error propagation, 2) that all so-called systematic errors belong to populations characterized by hitherto unnoticed frequency-based distributions, and 3) that they belong to subjectivist prior distributions. But, upon examination, the argument in terms of the law of error propagation is found to beg key controversial questions, the frequency-based distributions are found not always to be of suitable form, and the subjectivist distributions are found to be unrealistic. Thus the randomatic theory remains unjustified by objective standards. Moreover, its use could lead to the underestimation of uncertainties in the usual sense of the maximum possible or conceivable error in the result of a particular specified experiment. The concept of systematic error is argued to be indispensable and new recommendations are formulated which are orthodox in general character.},

Analyzing data from 7,674 participants across three different studies on the volunteer-based online experiment platform LabintheWild, we identified five motivation types for participating: boredom, comparison, fun, science, and self-learning. We found that these motivation types affect study selection, attention, and dropouts. Participants who were highly motivated by boredom paid less attention and were more likely to dropout than those who were motivated by the possibility of contributing to science. We additionally show that motivation can impact study results and suggest how researchers can take participants' motivation into account when designing and analyzing data from volunteer-based online experiments.},

abstract = {A number of interactive crowd-powered systems have been developed to solve difficult problems out of reach for automated solutions. To work interactively, such systems need access to on-demand labor. To meet this demand, workers can be (i) recruited when needed directly from the crowd marketplace, or (ii) recruited in advance and asked to wait in a retainer pool until they are needed. Most of the evaluations of these systems have been over a short time period, even though we know that marketplaces change and adapt over time. In this paper, we present the results of a 10-month deployment of a crowd-powered system that uses a hybrid approach to fast recruitment of workers that we call Ignition. We describe the Ignition approach and the observed times required to recruit workers from the marketplace and retainer over this long period of time. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to recruit workers with low latency even over long periods, and suggest a number of opportunities for future work for recruitment strategies and modeling that may further improve on-demand recruitment for deployed systems.},

abstract = {Data mining for intelligence led policing, Seite 62 The benefit of data mining for police seems tremendous, yet only a few limited applications are documented. This paper starts with describing the implementation problems of police data mining and introduces a new approach that tries to overcome these problems in the form of a data mining system with associative memory as the main technique. This technique makes the system easier to use, allows uncomplicated data handling and supports many different data types. Consequently, data preparation becomes easier and results contain more information. A number of Dutch police forces have already been using this system for several years with over 30 users. Since the analytical process within the police is very knowledge-intensive, a high level of domain expertise is essential, which makes it harder to find a police data miner with sufficient domain knowledge plus technical skills in the area of databases, statistics and data mining. The police domain also has data quality issues and a very diverse information need. This is why the system design tries to reduce the need for technical skills as much as possible by working with one standard datawarehouse, techniques that can be configured automatically and active user guidance. The ease of use is also ensured by integrating many tools and techniques from statistics, business intelligence and data mining into one interactive environment that does not require the analytical process to be designed beforehand. Instead, the analysis is performed through step by step interaction. This paper discusses the benefit of police data mining, the design of the system, a number of practical applications, best practices and success stories. Experiments have shown a factor 20 efficiency gain, a factor 2 prediction accuracy increase, a 15{\%} drop in crime rate, and 50{\%} more suspect recognition.},

Unlike most data mining techniques for finding correlational patterns, controlled experiments allow establishing a causal relationship with high probability. Experimenters can utilize the Scientific Method to form a hypothesis of the form " If a specific change is introduced, will it improve key metrics? " and evaluate it with real users. The theory of a controlled experiment dates back to Sir Ronald A. Fisher's experiments at the Rothamsted Agricultural Experimental Station in England in the 1920s, and the topic of offline experiments is well developed in Statistics (Box 2005). Online Controlled Experiments started to be used in the late 1990s with the growth of the Internet. Today, many large sites, including Amazon, Bing, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, and Yahoo! run thousands to tens of thousands of experiments each year testing user interface (UI) changes, enhancements to algorithms (search, ads, personalization, recommendation, etc.), changes to apps, content management system, etc. Online controlled experiments are now considered an indispensable tool, and their use is growing for startups and smaller websites. Controlled experiments are especially useful in combination with Agile software development (Martin 2008, Rubin 2012), Steve Blank's Customer Development process (Blank 2005), and MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) popularized by Eric Ries's Lean Startup (Ries 2011).},

At Microsoft, we have built the capability for running controlled experiments on web sites and services, thus enabling a more scientific approach to evaluating ideas at different stages of the planning process. In our previous papers, we did not have good examples of controlled experiments at Microsoft; now we do! The humbling results we share bring to question whether a-priori prioritization is as good as most people believe it is. The Experimentation Platform (ExP) was built to accelerate innovation through trustworthy experimentation. Along the way, we had to tackle both technical and cultural challenges and we provided software developers, program managers, and designers the benefit of an unbiased ear to listen to their customers and make data-driven decisions. A technical survey of the literature on controlled experiments was recently published by us in a journal (Kohavi, Longbotham, Sommerfield, {\&} Henne, 2009).

abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

abstract = {Abstract Community question answering (CQA) are collaborative online places where members ask questions for others to answer. Community members on these platforms share their expertise on various topics, from mechanical repairs to parenting. As a crowd-sourced service, such platforms not only depend on user-provided questions and answers, but also rely on their users for monitoring and flagging content that violates community rules.  This study focuses on user-reported flags to characterize the behavior of the good guys and bad guys in a popular community question answering, Yahoo Answers. Conventional wisdom is to eliminate the users who receive many flags. However, our analysis of a year of traces from Yahoo Answers shows that the number of flags does not tell the full story: on one hand, users with many flags may still contribute positively to the community. On the other hand, users who never get flagged are found to violate community rules and get their accounts suspended. This analysis, however, also shows that abusive users are betrayed by their network properties: we find strong evidence of homophilous behavior and use this finding to detect abusive users who go under the community radar. Based on our empirical observations, we build a classifier that is able to detect abusive users with an accuracy as high as 83{\%}.},

Here we report on the outcome of a project to collect stool samples on a large number of community dwelling elderly men using the OMNIgene-GUT stool/feces collection kit (OMR-200, DNA Genotek, Ottawa, Canada). Among 1328 men who were eligible for stool collection, 982 (74{\%}) agreed to participate and 951 submitted samples. The collection process was reported to be acceptable, almost all samples obtained were adequate, the process of sample handling by mail was uniformly successful. The DNA obtained provided excellent results in microbiome analyses, yielding an abundance of species and a diversity of taxa as would be predicted. Our results suggest that population studies of older participants involving remote stool sample collection are feasible. These approaches would allow large scale research projects of the association of the gut microbiota with important clinical outcomes.},

We explore the roots of this movement and some current projects to underscore the meaning of citizen science in science and schooling.

We use the examples of colony collapse disorder (CCD) and emerging trends of nanotechnology as cases in point. Then we justify three dialogical spheres of influence for future citizen science.

In a second experiment, we evaluate three distinct social compar-ison designs for the presentation of the results. As expected, the design that most emphasized participants' relative success led to most sharing. Contrary to our expectations, people who expected to do poorly benefited from the most optimistic so-cial comparison more than participants who expected to do better than others.},

abstract = {An important challenge in designing ubiquitous computing experiences is negotiating transitions between explicit and implicit interaction, such as how and when to provide users with notifications. While the paradigm of implicit interaction has important benefits, it is also susceptible to difficulties with hidden modes, unexpected action, and misunderstood intent. To address these issues, this work presents a framework for implicit interaction and applies it to the design of an interactive whiteboard application called Range. Range is a public interactive whiteboard designed to support co-located, ad-hoc meetings. It employs proximity sensing capability to proactively transition between display and authoring modes, to clear space for writing, and to cluster ink strokes. We show how the implicit interaction techniques of user reflection (how systems indicate to users what they perceive or infer), system demonstration (how systems indicate what they are doing), and override (how users can interrupt or stop a proactive system action) can prevent, mitigate, and correct errors in the whiteboard's proactive behaviors. These techniques can be generalized to improve the designs of a wide array of ubiquitous computing experiences.},

Drawing on a 12+ month ethnography and corroborating survey data, we detail the experiences of parents using Nightscout—an open source, DIY system for remotely monitoring blood glucose data— with their children who have type one diabetes. Managing diabetes with Nightscout is a deeply relational and (at times) contested activity for parent-caregivers, whose practices reveal the tensions and vulnerabilities of caregiving work enacted through data. As engagement with personal data becomes an increasingly powerful way people experience life, our findings call for alternative data narratives that reflect a multiplicity of emotional concerns and social arrangements.

abstract = {There has been a shift towards learning and consuming in-formation through video, but most academic research is still distributed only in text form. Limited time and resources pre-vent researchers from creating video versions of their work. Crowdsourcing this task is a promising alternative, but it re-quires solving complex coordination and collaborative video production problems. In this paper, we propose a scalable, end-to-end solution for crowdsourcing the creation of short research videos based on academic papers. To assist coordina-tion, we designed a structured workflow that enables efficient delegation of tasks, while also motivating the crowd through a collaborative learning environment. To facilitate video produc-tion, we developed an online system through which groups can make micro audio recordings that are automatically stitched together to create a complete talk. We tested this approach with a group of volunteers recruited from 52 countries through an open call. This distributed crowd produced over 100 video talks in 12 languages based on papers from top-tier computer science conferences. We evaluated the produced talks in part by soliciting feedback from the authors of the original papers: the authors typically rated the talks " very good " , giving a mean score of 4.1 out of 5. These results suggest that our crowdsourcing approach is a viable method for producing high-quality research talks at scale, increasing the distribution and accessibility of scientific knowledge.},

abstract = {The sharing economy has quickly become a very prominent subject of research in the broader computing literature and the in human–computer interaction (HCI) literature more specifically. When other computing research areas have experienced similarly rapid growth (e.g., human computation, eco-feedback technology), early stage literature reviews have proved useful and influential by identifying trends and gaps in the literature of interest and by providing key directions for short-and long-term future work. In this paper, we seek to provide the same benefits with respect to computing research on the sharing economy. Specifically, following the suggested approach of prior computing literature reviews, we conducted a systematic review of sharing economy articles published in the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library to investigate the state of sharing economy research in computing. We performed this review with two simultaneous foci: a broad focus toward the computing literature more generally and a narrow focus specifically on HCI literature. We collected a total of 112 sharing economy articles published between 2008 and 2017 and through our analysis of these papers, we make two core contributions: (1) an understanding of the computing community's contributions to our knowledge about the sharing economy, and specifically the role of the HCI community in these contributions (i.e., what has been done) and (2) a discussion of under-explored and unexplored aspects of the sharing economy that can serve as a partial research agenda moving forward (i.e. what is next to do). 1},

Dormouse is designed to enable cross-platform programming languages for social computation, so, for example, programs written for Mechanical Turk can also run on other crowdsourcing platforms. Dormouse also enables a programmer to easily combine crowdsourcing platforms or create new ones. Further, machines and people are both first-class citizens in Dormouse, allowing for natural parallelization and control flows for a broad range of data-intensive applications. And finally and importantly, Dormouse includes notions of real identity, heterogeneity, and social structure. We show that the unique properties of Dormouse enable elegant programming models for complex and useful problems, and we propose two such frameworks. ManReduce is a framework for combining human and machine computation into an intuitive parallel data flow that goes beyond existing frameworks in several important ways, such as enabling functions on arbitrary communication graphs between human and machine clusters. And Dog is a high-level procedural language written on top of ManReduce that focuses on expressivity and reuse. We explore two applications written in Dog: bootstrapping product recommendations without purchase data, and expert labeling of medical images.},

abstract = {Real-time crowdsourcing has made it possible to solve prob-lems that are beyond the scope of artificial intelligence (AI) within a matter of seconds, rather than hours or days with traditional crowdsourcing techniques. While this has led to an increase in the potential application domains of crowdsourcing and human computation, problems that require machine-level speeds—on the order of milliseconds, not seconds—have re-mained out of reach because of the fundamental bounds of human perception and response time. In this paper, we demon-strate that it is possible to exceed these bounds by combining human and machine intelligence. We introduce the look-ahead approach, a hybrid intelligence workflow that enables instan-taneous crowdsourcing systems (i.e., those that can return crowd responses within mere milliseconds). The look-ahead approach works by exploring possible future states that may be encountered within a short time horizon (e.g., a few seconds into the future) and prefetching crowd worker responses to these states. We validate the efficacy and explore the limita-tions of our approach on the Bolt system, which consists of an arcade-style game (Lightning Dodger) that we formally model as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). When the MDP reward function is unspecified—as in many real-world tasks— the look-ahead approach enables just-in-time (JIT) training of the agent's policy function. Through a series of crowd worker experiments, we demonstrate that the look-ahead approach can outperform the fastest individual worker by approximately two orders of magnitude. Our work opens new avenues for hybrid intelligence systems that are as smart as people, but also far faster than humanly possible.},

abstract = {We study the problem of troubleshooting machine learning systems that rely on analytical pipelines of distinct components. Understanding and fixing errors that arise in such integrative systems is difficult as failures can occur at multiple points in the execution workflow. Moreover, errors can propagate, become amplified or be suppressed, making blame assignment difficult. We propose a human-in-the-loop methodology which leverages human intellect for troubleshooting system failures. The approach simulates potential component fixes through human computation tasks and measures the expected improvements in the holistic behavior of the system. The method provides guidance to designers about how they can best improve the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on an automated image captioning system that has been pressed into real-world use.},

abstract = {Medical doctors occasionally discover potentially valuable new off-label uses for drugs during their clinical practice. They apply these to help their own patients, but often have minimal incentives to invest in diffusing them further. Thus, the benefits that other clinicians might obtain are to some extent an externality from the perspective of the discoverer. This represents a form of market failure: effort invested in diffusion could lower adoption costs for many, but few innovators will invest that effort  and social welfare will be accordingly reduced. In this study we explore for empirical evidence for the market failure just described, and do find evidence for it. In a sample of US clinicians, diffusion efforts increase the diffusion of generally valuable discoveries, but innovating clinicians typically invest little to support diffusion. We conclude with a discussion of how such a market failure could be addressed.},

We present Squadbox, a tool to help recipients of email harassment coordinate a " squad " of friend moderators to shield and support them during at-tacks. Friend moderators intercept email from strangers and can reject, organize, and redirect emails, as well as collaborate on filters. Squadbox is designed to let its users implement highly customized workflows, as we found in interviews that harassment and preferences for mitigating it vary widely. We evaluated Squadbox on five pairs of friends in a field study, finding that participants could comfortably navigate around privacy and personalization concerns.},

abstract = {Personalization aims to tailor content to a person's individual tastes. As a result, the tasks that benefit from personalization are inherently subjective. Many of the most robust approaches to personalization rely on large sets of other people's preferences. However, existing preference data is not always available. In these cases, we propose leveraging online crowds to provide on-demand personalization. We introduce and evaluate two methods for personalized crowdsourcing: taste-matching for finding crowd workers who are similar to the requester, and taste-grokking, where crowd workers explicitly predict the requester's tastes. Both approaches show improvement over a non-personalized baseline, with taste-grokking performing well in simpler tasks and taste-matching performing well with larger crowds and tasks with latent decisionmaking variables.},

@article{Lee2017,
abstract = {Low-fidelity prototyping at the early stages of user interface (UI) design can help designers and system builders quickly explore their ideas. However, interactive behaviors in such prototypes are often replaced by textual descriptions because it usually takes even professionals hours or days to create ani-mated interactive elements due to the complexity of creating them. In this paper, we introduce SketchExpress, a crowd-powered prototyping tool that enables crowd workers to create reusable interactive behaviors easily and accurately. With the system, a requester—designers or end-users—describes aloud how an interface should behave and crowd workers make the sketched prototype interactive within minutes using a demonstrate-remix-replay approach. These behaviors are manually demonstrated, refined using remix functions, and then can be replayed later. The recorded behaviors persist for future reuse to help users communicate with the animated pro-totype. We conducted a study with crowd workers recruited from Mechanical Turk, which demonstrated that workers could create animations using SketchExpress in 2.9 minutes on aver-age with 27{\%} gain in the quality of animations compared to the baseline condition of manual demonstration.},

However, it is an open question whether the success of Wikipedia results from a wisdom of crowds type of effect in which a large number of people each make a small number of edits, or whether it is driven by a core group of elite users who do the lions share of the work. In this study we examined how the influence of elite vs. common users changed over time in Wikipedia. The results suggest that although Wikipedia was driven by the influence of elite users early on, more recently there has been a dramatic shift in workload to the common user. We also show the same shift in del.icio.us, a very different type of social collaborative knowledge system. We discuss how these results mirror the dynamics found in more traditional social collectives, and how they can influence the design of new collaborative knowledge systems.},

However, current methods for engag-ing urban populations in participatory design (PD) activities are somewhat limited. In this article, we describe an approach taken to empower socially disadvantaged citizens, using a variety of both social and technologi-cal tools, in a Smart City project. Through analysing the nature of citizens' concerns and proposed solutions, we explore the benefits of our approach, arguing that engaging citizens can uncover hyper-local concerns that provide a foundation for finding solutions to address citizen concerns. By reflecting on our approach, we identify four key challenges to utilising PD at an urban scale; balancing scale with the personal, who has con-trol of the process, who is participating and integrating citizen-led work with local authorities. By addressing these challenges, we will be able to truly engage citizens as collaborators in co-designing their city.},

abstract = {Figure 1. Given a graphical user interface (left), AdaM automatically decides which UI elements should be displayed on each device in real-time. Our optimization is designed for multi-user scenarios and considers user roles and preferences, device access restrictions and device characteristics. ABSTRACT Developing cross-device multi-user interfaces (UIs) is a chal-lenging problem. There are numerous ways in which content and interactivity can be distributed. However, good solutions must consider multiple users, their roles, their preferences and access rights, as well as device capabilities. Manual and rule-based solutions are tedious to create and do not scale to larger problems nor do they adapt to dynamic changes, such as users leaving or joining an activity. In this paper, we cast the problem of UI distribution as an assignment problem and pro-pose to solve it using combinatorial optimization. We present a mixed integer programming formulation which allows real-time applications in dynamically changing collaborative set-tings. It optimizes the allocation of UI elements based on device capabilities, user roles, preferences, and access rights. We present a proof-of-concept designer-in-the-loop tool, al-lowing for quick solution exploration. Finally, we compare our approach to traditional paper prototyping in a lab study.},

abstract = {The growth model of the 20th century required that designers and companies achieve economies of scale. Scaling up involved abstraction to make large-scale production possible for the global industrial economy. In the 21st century, social challenges are increasingly disrupting world markets. This changes the focus of the design process. Designers once needed to learn just a little about large groups of people to serve mass markets. Today, they must learn a great deal about relatively small num- bers of people. They must shift from concentrating on what makes groups of people similar to what makes them different. This article explores the process of “scaling down” by describing key principles. It examines these principles at work in three case studies from The Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design to develop a lighting system for inner-city housing estates, a plan- ning tool to create better workplaces, and a suicide-prevention strategy for a public health black spot.},

abstract = {Source-code examples of APIs enable developers to quickly gain a gestalt understanding of a library's functionality, and they support organically creating applications by incre- mentally modifying a functional starting point. As an increasing number of web sites provide APIs, significant latent value lies in connecting the complementary repre- sentations between site and service—in essence, enabling sites themselves to be the example corpus. We introduce d.mix, a tool for creating web mashups that leverages this site-to-service correspondence. With d.mix, users browse annotated web sites and select elements to sample. d.mix's sampling mechanism generates the underlying service calls that yield those elements. This code can be edited, executed, and shared in d.mix's wiki-based hosting environment. This sampling approach leverages pre-existing web sites as example sets and supports fluid composition and modifica- tion of examples. An initial study with eight participants found d.mix to enable rapid experimentation, and suggested avenues for improving its annotation mechanism.},

How might computational tools increase the efficacy of UI revision? This paper introduces d.note, a revision tool for user interfaces expressed as control flow diagrams. d.note introduces a command set for modifying and annotating both appearance and behavior of user interfaces; it also defines execution semantics so proposed changes can be tested immediately. The paper reports two studies that compare production and interpretation of revisions in d.note to freeform sketching on static images (the status quo). The revision production study showed that testing of ideas during the revision process led to more concrete revisions, but that the tool also affected the type and number of suggested changes. The revision interpreta- tion study showed that d.note revisions required fewer clarifications, and that additional techniques for expressing revision intent could be beneficial.},

abstract = {Sensors are becoming increasingly important in interaction design. Authoring a sensor-based interaction comprises three steps: choosing and connecting the appropriate hardware, creating application logic, and specifying the relationship between sensor values and application logic. Recent research has successfully addressed the first two issues. However, linking sensor input data to application logic remains an exercise in patience and trial-and-error testing for most designers. This paper introduces techniques for authoring sensor-based interactions by demonstration. A combination of direct manipulation and pattern recognition techniques enables designers to control how demonstrated examples are generalized to interaction rules. This approach emphasizes design exploration by enabling very rapid iterative demonstrate-edit-review cycles. This paper describes the manifestation of these techniques in a design tool, Exemplar, and presents evaluations through a first-use lab study and a theoretical analysis using the Cognitive Dimensions of Notation framework.},

It will involve very close coupling between the human and the electronic members of the partnership. The main aims are 1) to let computers facilitate formulative thinking as they now facilitate the solution of formulated problems, and 2) to enable men and computers to cooperate in making decisions and controlling complex situations without inflexible dependence on predetermined programs. In the anticipated symbiotic part-nership, men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, deter-mine the criteria, and perform the evaluations. Computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions in technical and scientific thinking. Preliminary analyses indicate that the sym-biotic partnership will perform intellectual operations much more effectively than man alone can perform them. Prerequisites for the achievement of the effective, cooperative association include developments in computer time sharing, in memory components, in memory organization, in programming lan-guages, and in input and output equipment.},

A growing body of preclinical literature has demonstrated bidirectional signaling between the brain and the gut microbiome, involving multiple neurocrine and endocrine signaling mechanisms. While psychological and physical stressors can affect the composition and metabolic activity of the gut microbiota, experimental changes to the gut microbiome can affect emotional behavior and related brain systems. These findings have resulted in speculation that alterations in the gut microbiome may play a pathophysiological role in human brain diseases, including autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain. Ongoing large-scale population-based studies of the gut microbiome and brain imaging studies looking at the effect of gut microbiome modulation on brain responses to emotion-related stimuli are seeking to validate these speculations.

The need for the peer-review system has often been debated as in numerous cases it has failed in its task and in most of these cases editors and the reviewers were thought to be responsible for not being able to correctly judge the quality of the work. This raises a question "Can the peer-review system be improved?" Since editors and reviewers are the most important pillars of a reviewing system, we in this work, attempt to address a related question - given the editing/reviewing history of the editors or reviewers "can we identify the under-performing ones?", with citations received by the edited/reviewed papers being used as proxy for quantifying performance. We term such reviewers and editors as anomalous and we believe identifying and removing them shall improve the performance of the peer-review system. Using a massive dataset of Journal of High Energy Physics (JHEP) consisting of 29k papers submitted between 1997 and 2015 with 95 editors and 4035 reviewers and their review history, we identify several factors which point to anomalous behavior of referees and editors. In fact the anomalous editors and reviewers account for 26.8{\%} and 14.5{\%} of the total editors and reviewers respectively and for most of these anomalous reviewers the performance degrades alarmingly over time.},

abstract = {As HCI researchers have explored the possibilities of human computation, they have paid less attention to ethics and values of crowdwork. This paper offers an analysis of Amazon Mechanical Turk, a popular human computation system, as a site of technically mediated worker-employer relations. We argue that human computation currently relies on worker invisibility. We then present Turkopticon, an activist system that allows workers to publicize and evaluate their relationships with employers. As a common infrastructure, Turkopticon also enables workers to engage one another in mutual aid. We conclude by discussing the potentials and challenges of sustaining activist technologies that intervene in large, existing socio-technical systems.},

abstract = {Researchers in HCI and behavioral science are increasingly exploring the use of technology to support behavior change in domains such as health and sustainability. This work, however, remain largely siloed within the two communities. We begin to address this silo problem by attempting to build a bridge between the two disciplines at the level of behavioral theory. Specifically, we define core theoretical terms to create shared understanding about what theory is, discuss ways in which behavioral theory can be used to inform research on behavior change technologies, identify shortcomings in current behavioral theories, and outline ways in which HCI researchers can not only interpret and utilize behavioral science theories but also contribute to improving them.},

abstract = {Many architects believe that major improvements in cost-energy-performance must now come from domain-specific hardware. This paper evaluates a custom ASIC—called a ​ Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) ​ — deployed in datacenters since 2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural networks (NN). The heart of the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a peak throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed on-chip memory. The TPU's deterministic execution model is a better match to the 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are the time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs (caches, out-of-order execution, multithreading, multiprocessing, prefetching, {\ldots}) that help average throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and an Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters. Our workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95{\%} of our datacenters' NN inference demand. Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is on average about 15X -30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU, with TOPS/Watt about 30X -80X higher. Moreover, using the GPU's GDDR5 memory in the TPU would triple achieved TOPS and raise TOPS/Watt to nearly 70X the GPU and 200X the CPU.

@article{Karpathy2016,
abstract = {A long-standing goal in the field of artificial intelligence is to develop agents that can perceive and understand the rich visual world around us and who can communicate with us about it in natural language. Significant strides have been made towards this goal over the last few years due to simultaneous advances in computing infrastructure, data gathering and algorithms. The progress has been especially rapid in visual recognition, where computers can now classify images into categories with a performance that rivals that of humans, or even surpasses it in some cases such as classifying breeds of dogs. However, despite much encouraging progress, most of the advances in visual recognition still take place in the context of assigning one or a few discrete labels to an image (e.g. person, boat, keyboard ,etc.). In this dissertation we develop models and techniques that allow us to connect the domain of visual data and the domain of natural language utterances, enabling translation between elements of the two domains. In particular, first we introduce a model that embeds both images and sentences into a common multi-modal embedding space. This space then allows us to identify images that depict an arbitrary sentence description and conversely, we can identify sentences that describe any image. Second, we develop an image captioning model that takes an image and directly generates a sentence description without being constrained a finite collection of human-written sentences to choose from. Lastly, we describe a model that can take an image and both localize and describe all if its salient parts. We demonstrate that this model can also be used backwards to take any arbitrary description (e.g. white tennis shoes) and efficiently localize the described concept in a large collection of images. We argue that these models, the techniques they take advantage of internally and the interactions they enable are a stepping stone towards artificial intelligence and that connecting images and natural language offers many practical benefits and immediate valuable applications. From the modeling perspective, instead of designing and staging explicit algorithms to process images and sentences in complex processing pipelines, our contribution lies in the design of hybrid convolutional and recurrent neural network architectures that connect visual data and natural language utterances with a single network. Therefore, the computational processing of images, sentences, and the structure of the multimodal embeddings that associate them emerges automatically during the process of optimizing a loss function with respect to the network's parameters over training datasets of images and their captions. This approach enjoys many of the benefits of neural networks including the use of simple, homogeneous computations that are easy to parallelize on hardware, and strong performance due to end-to-end training that formulates the problem as a single optimization problem in which all components of the model share the same end objective. We show that our models advance the state of the art on tasks that require joint processing of images and natural language and that we can design the architectures in ways that facilitate interpretable visual inspection of the network's predictions.},

@article{Kraska2017,
abstract = {Indexes are models: a B-Tree-Index can be seen as a model to map a key to the position of a record within a sorted array, a Hash-Index as a model to map a key to a position of a record within an unsorted array, and a BitMap-Index as a model to indicate if a data record exists or not. In this exploratory research paper, we start from this premise and posit that all existing index structures can be replaced with other types of models, including deep-learning models, which we term learned indexes. The key idea is that a model can learn the sort order or structure of lookup keys and use this signal to effectively predict the position or existence of records. We theoretically analyze under which conditions learned indexes outperform traditional index structures and describe the main challenges in designing learned index structures. Our initial results show, that by using neural nets we are able to outperform cache-optimized B-Trees by up to 70{\%} in speed while saving an order-of-magnitude in memory over several real-world data sets. More importantly though, we believe that the idea of replacing core components of a data management system through learned models has far reaching implications for future systems designs and that this work just provides a glimpse of what might be possible.},

While designers use spatial models to support interaction, we show how it is actually a notion of “place” which fram-es interactive behaviour.

abstract = {Microfluidic-based biochips are replacing the conventional biochemical analyzers, and are able to integrate all the necessary functions for biochemical analysis. The digital microfluidic biochips are based on the manipulation of liquids not as a continuous flow, but as discrete droplets. Several approaches have been proposed for the synthesis of digital microfluidic biochips, which, starting from a biochemical application and a given biochip architecture, determine the allocation, resource binding, scheduling, placement and routing of the operations in the application. Researchers have assumed that each biochemical operation in an application is characterized by a worst-case execution time (wcet). However, during the execution of the application, due to variability and randomness in biochemical reactions, operations may finish earlier than their wcets , resulting in unexploited slack in the schedule. In this paper, we first propose an online synthesis strategy that re-synthesizes the application at runtime when operations experience variability in their execution time, exploiting thus the slack to obtain shorter application completion times. We also propose a quasi-static synthesis strategy that determines offline a database of alternative implementations. During the execution of the application, several implementations are selected based on the current execution scenario with operation execution time variability. The proposed strategies have been evaluated using several benchmarks and compared to related work. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {A number of interactive crowd-powered systems have been developed to solve difficult problems out of reach for automated solutions. To work interactively, such systems need access to on-demand labor. To meet this demand, workers can be (i) recruited when needed directly from the crowd marketplace, or (ii) recruited in advance and asked to wait in a retainer pool until they are needed. Most of the evaluations of these systems have been over a short time period, even though we know that marketplaces change and adapt over time. In this paper, we present the results of a 10-month deployment of a crowd-powered system that uses a hybrid approach to fast recruitment of workers that we call Ignition. We describe the Ignition approach and the observed times required to recruit workers from the marketplace and retainer over this long period of time. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to recruit workers with low latency even over long periods, and suggest a number of opportunities for future work for recruitment strategies and modeling that may further improve on-demand recruitment for deployed systems.},

abstract = {Building on recent prior work that combines Google Street View (GSV) and crowdsourcing to remotely collect information on physical world accessibility, we present the first 'smart' system, Tohme, that combines machine learning, computer vision (CV), and custom crowd interfaces to find curb ramps remotely in GSV scenes. Tohme consists of two workflows, a human labeling pipeline and a CV pipeline with human verification, which are scheduled dynamically based on predicted performance. Using 1,086 GSV scenes (street intersections) from four North American cities and data from 403 crowd workers, we show that Tohme performs similarly in detecting curb ramps compared to a manual labeling approach alone (F- measure: 84{\%} vs. 86{\%} baseline) but at a 13{\%} reduction in time cost. Our work contributes the first CV-based curb ramp detection system, a custom machine-learning based workflow controller, a validation of GSV as a viable curb ramp data source, and a detailed examination of why curb ramp detection is a hard problem along with steps forward.},

abstract = {People find jobs through their social networks using ties of different strengths. Intuitively weak ties might be less useful because people communicate less often with them, or more useful because they provide novel information. Granovetter's early work showed that more job-seekers get help via acquaintances than friends (Granovetter, 1973). However, recent work on job-finding (Gee et al., 2017) shows an apparent paradox of weak ties in the United States: most people are helped through one of their numerous weak ties, but a single stronger tie is significantly more valuable at the margin. Although some studies have addressed the importance of weak ties in job finding within specific countries, this is the first paper to use a single dataset and methodology to compare the importance of weak ties across countries. Here, we use de-identified data from almost 17 million social ties in 55 countries to document the widespread existence of this paradox of weak ties across many societies. More people get jobs where their weak ties work. However, this is not because weak ties are more helpful than strong ties – it is because they are more numerous. In every country, the likelihood of going to work where an individual friend works is increasing – not decreasing – with tie strength. Yet, there is substantial variation in the added value of a strong tie at the margin across these countries. We show that the level of income inequality in a country is positively correlated with the added value of a strong tie, so that individual strong ties matter more when there is greater income inequality.},

abstract = {Program Synthesis, which is the task of discovering programs that realize user intent, can be useful in several scenarios: discovery of new algorithms, helping regular programmers automatically discover tricky/mundane programming details, enabling people with no programming background to develop scripts for performing repetitive tasks (end-user programming), and even problem solving in the context of automating teaching. In this tutorial, I will describe the three key dimensions that should be taken into account in designing any program synthesis system: expression of user intent, space of programs over which to search, and the search technique [1]. (i) The user intent can be expressed in the form of logical relations between inputs and outputs, input-output examples, demonstrations, natural language, and inefficient or related programs. (ii) The search space can be over imperative or functional programs (with possible restrictions on the control structure or the operator set), or over restricted models of computations such as regular/context-free grammars/transducers, or succinct logical representations. (iii) The search technique can be based on exhaustive search, version space algebras, machine learning techniques (such as belief propagation or genetic programming), or logical reasoning techniques based on SAT/SMT solvers. I will illustrate these concepts by brief description of various program synthesis projects that target synthesis of a wide variety of programs such as standard undergraduate textbook algorithms (e.g., sorting, dynamic programming), program inverses (e.g., decoders, deserializers), bitvector manipulation routines, deobfuscated programs, graph algorithms, text-manipulating routines, geometry algorithms etc.},

abstract = {Online social networking services distribute various types of messages geared towards providing increased value to their members. Common types of messages include news, con-nection requests, membership notifications, promotions, and event notifications. Such communication, if used judiciously, can provide an enormous value to the members. However sending a message for every instance of news, connection re-quest, or the like can result in an overwhelming number of messages in a member's mailbox. This may result in reduced effectiveness of communication if the messages are not suffi-ciently relevant to the member's interests, and potentially a poor brand perception. In this paper, we discuss our strat-egy and experience with regard to the problem of email vol-ume optimization at LinkedIn. In particular, we present a cost-benefit analysis of sending emails, the key factors to administer an effective volume optimization, our algorithm for volume optimization, the architecture of the supporting system, and experimental results from online A/B tests.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND There are few empirical data to inform the debate surrounding the use and regulation of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genome-wide disease risk tests. This study aimed to determine the long term psychological, behavioural, and clinical impacts of genomic risk testing for common disease. METHODS The Scripps Genomic Health Initiative is a prospective longitudinal cohort study of adults who purchased the Navigenics Health Compass, a commercially available genomic test. Web based assessments were administered at baseline, short (3 months), and long term (1 year) follow-up. RESULTS 2240 participants completed either or both follow-ups and a subset of 1325 completed long term follow-up. There were no significant differences from baseline in anxiety (p=0.50), fat intake (p=0.34), or exercise (p=0.39) at long term follow-up, and 96.8{\%} of the sample had no test related distress. Longitudinal linear mixed model analyses were consistent with results of cross-sectional analyses. Screening test completion was associated with sharing genomic test results with a physician (36.0{\%} shared; p{\textless}0.001) and perceived utility of the test (61.5{\%} high perceived utility; p=0.002), but was not associated with the genomic risk estimate values themselves. CONCLUSIONS Over a third of DTC genomic test recipients shared their results with their own physician during an approximate 1 year follow-up period, and this sharing was associated with higher screening test completion. Genomic testing was not associated with long term psychological risks, and most participants reportedly perceived the test to be of high personal utility.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Genetic research in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is mainly performed in minors who are legally unable to provide consent. Thus, knowledge of the attitudes, fears, and expectations toward genetic research of the parents is important. Knowledge of the attitudes toward genetic research will improve cooperation between researchers and participants, and help establish confidence in ASD genetic research. The present study aimed to assess these attitudes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Questionnaire-based assessments of attitudes toward genetic research and toward procedures in genetic research of n=1455 parents of individuals with ASD were performed.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The main motivation for participation in genetic research is to gain more knowledge of the causes and disease mechanisms of ASD (83.6{\%}), and to contribute toward development of improved treatment in the future (63.7{\%}). The parents also had a positive attitude towards storing genetic information (54.3{\%}) and they requested confidentiality of data (82.9{\%}) and expressed a need to be informed about the purpose (89{\%}) and progress of the research (83.7{\%}). We found a slightly more positive attitude to participation in genetic research among older parents (P=0.015), among fathers compared with mothers (P=0.01), among parents of girls compared with boys (P=0.03), and infantile autism compared with Asperger syndrome (P=0.002). However, linear regression analysis showed that parent and child characteristics seem to have too small an influence on attitudes toward genetic research to be of any relevance (R=0.002-0.02).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Parents of children with ASD have, in general, a very positive attitude toward genetic research. Data confidentiality is important, and they express a need for information on the purpose and progress of the research.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, microbiome research has dramatically reshaped our understanding of human biology. New insights range from an enhanced un-derstanding of how microbes mediate digestion and disease processes (e.g., in inflammatory bowel disease) to surprising associations with Parkinson's disease, autism, and depression. In this review, we describe how new genera-tions of sequencing technology, analytical advances coupled to new software capabilities, and the integration of animal model data have led to these new discoveries. We also discuss the prospects for integrating studies of the mi-crobiome, metabolome, and immune system, with the goal of elucidating mechanisms that govern their interactions. This systems-level understand-ing will change how we think about ourselves as organisms. 3.1},

abstract = {This paper presents the perspective that sustainability can and should be a central focus of interaction design-a perspective that is termed Sustainable Interaction Design (SID). As a starting point for a perspective of sustainability, design is defined as an act of choosing among or informing choices of future ways of being. This perspective of sustainability is presented in terms of design values, methods, and reasoning. The paper proposes (i) a rubric for understanding the material effects of particular interaction design cases in terms of forms of use, reuse, and disposal, and (ii) several principles to guide SID. The paper illustrates--with particular examples of design critique for interactive products and appeals to secondary research--how two of these principles may be applied to move the effects of designs from less preferred forms of use to more preferred ones. Finally, a vision for incorporating sustainability into the research and practice of interaction design is described.},

We describe our data collection process that allows us to gather data from diverse sources at high throughput. Using Spark as our analysis tool, we study the impact of social engagement on startup fund raising success. We further define novel metrics that allowus to quantify the behavior of investors to followand make in- vestment decisions as communities rather than individuals. Finally, we explore visualization techniques that allow us to visualize com- munities of investors that make decisions in a close-knit fashion vs looser communities where investors largely make independent de- cisions. We conclude with a discussion on our ongoing research on causality analysis and new community detection algorithms.},

@article{Mason2012a,
abstract = {Complex problems in science, business, and engineering typically require some tradeoff between exploitation of known solutions and exploration for novel ones, where, in many cases, information about known solutions can also disseminate among individual problem solvers through formal or informal networks. Prior research on complex problem solving by collectives has found the counterintuitive result that inefficient networks, meaning networks that disseminate information relatively slowly, can perform better than efficient networks for problems that require extended exploration. In this paper, we report on a series of 256 Web-based experiments in which groups of 16 individuals collectively solved a complex problem and shared information through different communication networks. As expected, we found that collective exploration improved average success over independent exploration because good solutions could diffuse through the network. In contrast to prior work, however, we found that efficient networks outperformed inefficient networks, even in a problem space with qualitative properties thought to favor inefficient networks. We explain this result in terms of individual-level explore-exploit decisions, which we find were influenced by the network structure as well as by strategic considerations and the relative payoff between maxima. We conclude by discussing implications for real-world problem solving and possible extensions.},

abstract = {In their initial articulation of the direction of the CSCW field scholars advanced – and continue to advance - an open-ended agenda. However, trawling through the major CSCW outlets, this is not what one finds in practice. Rather the field appears to privilege particular forms of cooperative work. These are studies of restricted and confined settings - or what might be termed more generally as localist studies of the ‘here and now'. This focus is particularly problematic when one considers the kinds of large-scale, integrated and interconnected workplace information technologies – or what we are calling Information Infrastructures (II) – that can be found within and across organisations today. CSCW appears unable (or unwilling) to grapple with these technologies - which were at the outset envisaged as falling within the scope of the field. Our paper hopes to facilitate greater CSCW attention to Information Infrastructures through offering a re-conceptualisation of the role and nature of ‘design'. In particular we focus on the two themes of ‘standardisation' and ‘heterogeneity' which we find to be present but largely unaccounted for in CSCW studies. We discuss these themes through introducing material from our own studies.},

abstract = {AsMOOCs grow in popularity, the relatively low completion rates of learners has been a central criticism. This focus on completion rates, however, reflects a monolithic view of dis- engagement that does not allow MOOC designers to target interventions or develop adaptive course features for particu- lar subpopulations of learners. To address this, we present a simple, scalable, and informative classification method that identifies a small number of longitudinal engagement tra- jectories in MOOCs. Learners are classified based on their patterns of interaction with video lectures and assessments, the primary features of most MOOCs to date. In an analysis of three computer science MOOCs, the classifier consistently identifies four prototypical trajectories of engagement. The most notable of these is the learners who stay engaged through the course without taking assess- ments. These trajectories are also a useful framework for the comparison of learner engagement between different course structures or instructional approaches. We compare learners in each trajectory and course across demographics, forum participation, video access, and reports of overall experi- ence. These results inform a discussion of future interven- tions, research, and design directions for MOOCs. Poten- tial improvements to the classification mechanism are also discussed, including the introduction of more fine-grained analytics.},

Lots of professors have written guides on the faculty job search process, so I will try to avoid repeating their advice.

UC Berkeley's career center also has a useful guide [8]. Finally, Tao Xie maintains, to my knowledge, the most comprehensive advice collection [11] for aspiring and current professors. I hope that this document complements all of these excellent resources.

abstract = {Do people treat computers as social actors? To answer this question, researchers have measured the extent to which computers elicit social responses in people, such as impression management strategies for influencing the perceptions of others. But on this question findings in the literature conflict. To make sense of these findings, the present study proposes a dual-process model of impression management in human-computer interaction. The model predicts that, although machines may elicit nonconscious impression management strategies, they do not generally elicit conscious impression management strategies. One such strategy is presenting oneself favorably to others, which can be measured as social desirability bias when comparing self-reported preferences with implicit preferences. The current study uses both a questionnaire and an implicit association test (IAT) to compare attitudes toward human and machine speech. Although past studies on social desirability bias have demonstrated people's tendency to underreport their preference for the preferred group when comparing two human groups, the current study found that, when comparing human speech and machine-synthesized speech, participants instead overreported their preference for the preferred (human) group. This finding supports the proposed dual-process model of impression management, because participants did not consciously treat computers as social actors. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The dominant crowdsourcing infrastructure today is the workflow, which decomposes goals into small independent tasks. However, complex goals such as design and engineering have remained stubbornly difficult to achieve with crowdsourcing workflows. Is this due to a lack of imagination, or a more fundamental limit? This paper explores this question through in-depth case studies of 22 workers across six workflow-based crowd teams, each pursuing a complex and interdependent web development goal. We used an inductive mixed method approach to analyze behavior trace data, chat logs, survey responses and work artifacts to understand how workers enacted and adapted the crowdsourcing workflows. Our results indicate that workflows served as useful coordination artifacts, but in many cases critically inhibited crowd workers from pursuing real-time adaptations to their work plans. However, the CSCW and organizational behavior literature argues that all sufficiently complex goals require open-ended adaptation.

abstract = {Plans and planning assume a central role and challenge of collaborative scientific work, bridging and coordinating often discordant rhythms and events emanating from the organizational, infrastructural, biographical and phenomenal dimensions of collaborative life. Plans align rhythms embedded in local practice with those operating at larger institutional levels, and establish shared temporal baselines around which local choice and action may be calibrated. This paper develops these arguments through ethnographic study of the Ocean Observatories Initiative, a prominent U.S.-based large-scale long-term collaborative research program in the ocean sciences. We emphasize the intersection between rhythms and plans at two crucial moments: formation ('plans-in-the-making'), and enactment ('plans-in-action') across complex fields of practice. Our findings hold important implications for CSCW research and practice around scientific and largescale collaborative efforts, and for federal science policies meant to support productive forms of cooperation and discovery.

In this paper, we present a new approach to impart these skills, consisting of: 1) explicit instruction on programming problem solving, which frames coding as a process of translating mental representations of problems and solutions into source code, 2) a method of visualizing and monitoring progression through six problem solving stages, 3) explicit, on-demand prompts for learners to reflect on their strategies when seeking help from instructors, and 4) context-sensitive help embedded in a code editor that reinforces the problem solving instruction. We experimentally evaluated the effects of our intervention across two 2-week web development summer camps with 48 high school students, finding that the intervention increased productivity, independence, programming self-efficacy, metacognitive awareness, and growth mindset. We discuss the implications of these results on learning technologies and classroom instruction.},

abstract = {Prior work on creativity support tools demonstrates how a computational semantic model of a solution space can enable interventions that substantially improve the number, quality and diversity of ideas. However, automated semantic model-ing often falls short when people contribute short text snip-pets or sketches. Innovation platforms can employ humans to provide semantic judgments to construct a semantic model, but this relies on external workers completing a large num-ber of tedious micro tasks. This requirement threatens both accuracy (external workers may lack expertise and context to make accurate semantic judgments) and scalability (external workers are costly). In this paper, we introduce IDEAHOUND, an ideation system that seamlessly integrates the task of defin-ing semantic relationships among ideas into the primary task of idea generation. The system combines implicit human actions with machine learning to create a computational se-mantic model of the emerging solution space. The integrated nature of these judgments allows IDEAHOUND to leverage the expertise and efforts of participants who are already moti-vated to contribute to idea generation, overcoming the issues of scalability inherent to existing approaches. Our results show that participants were equally willing to use (and just as productive using) IDEAHOUND compared to a conventional platform that did not require organizing ideas. Our integrated crowdsourcing approach also creates a more accurate seman-tic model than an existing crowdsourced approach (performed by external crowds). We demonstrate how this model enables helpful creative interventions: providing diverse inspirational examples, providing similar ideas for a given idea and pro-viding a visual overview of the solution space.},

@article{Zevin2017,
abstract = {(abridged for arXiv) With the first direct detection of gravitational waves, the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) has initiated a new field of astronomy by providing an alternate means of sensing the universe. The extreme sensitivity required to make such detections is achieved through exquisite isolation of all sensitive components of LIGO from non-gravitational-wave disturbances. Nonetheless, LIGO is still susceptible to a variety of instrumental and environmental sources of noise that contaminate the data. Of particular concern are noise features known as glitches, which are transient and non-Gaussian in their nature, and occur at a high enough rate so that accidental coincidence between the two LIGO detectors is non-negligible. In this paper we describe an innovative project that combines crowdsourcing with machine learning to aid in the challenging task of categorizing all of the glitches recorded by the LIGO detectors. Through the Zooniverse platform, we engage and recruit volunteers from the public to categorize images of glitches into pre-identified morphological classes and to discover new classes that appear as the detectors evolve. In addition, machine learning algorithms are used to categorize images after being trained on human-classified examples of the morphological classes. Leveraging the strengths of both classification methods, we create a combined method with the aim of improving the efficiency and accuracy of each individual classifier. The resulting classification and characterization should help LIGO scientists to identify causes of glitches and subsequently eliminate them from the data or the detector entirely, thereby improving the rate and accuracy of gravitational-wave observations. We demonstrate these methods using a small subset of data from LIGO's first observing run.},

In a research process, its often unclear what in- gredients; or what recipe or process, which if repeated produces a publishable paper. Meanwhile, experienced researchers with novel ideas are constrained with lim- ited time and funding resources; and motivated students with exceptional skill-sets lack direction or research mentor. In this proposal, I introduce a research direction which explores the possibility of expert crowdsourcing the research process, by connecting mentor with student crowd. The process would allow mentors to systemati- cally use operators such as split, merge, remove or add on project ideas, code or students to manage research process and crowd. The process would include series of research phases like, brainstorming, paper-pencil pro- totyping, development and user-evaluation to produce publishable results. Encouraged by prior pilot experi- ment findings, my doctoral research examines the pos- sibility of crowdsourcing the research process using op- erators along the research phase, while solving resource and opportunity constraints among mentor and crowd.

abstract = {Citizen science, the involvement of volunteers in research, has increased the scale of ecological field studies with continent-wide, centralized monitoring efforts and, more rarely, tapping of volunteers to conduct large, coordinated, field experiments. The unique benefit for the field of ecology lies in understanding processes occurring at broad geographic scales and on private lands, which are impossible to sample extensively with traditional field research models. Citizen science produces large, longitudinal data sets, whose potential for error and bias is poorly understood. Because it does not usually aim to uncover mechanisms underlying ecological patterns, citizen science is best viewed as complementary to more localized, hypothesis-driven research. In the process of addressing the impacts of current, global ?experiments? altering habitat and climate, large-scale citizen science has led to new, quantitative approaches to emerging questions about the distribution and abundance of organisms across space and time.},

abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease, the etiology of which involves both genetic and environmental factors. The exact nature of the environmental factors responsible for predisposition to MS remains elusive; however, it's hypothesized that gastrointestinal microbiota might play an important role in pathogenesis of MS. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate whether gut microbiota are altered in MS by comparing the fecal microbiota in relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) (n = 31) patients to that of age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n = 36). Phylotype profiles of the gut microbial populations were generated using hypervariable tag sequencing of the V3-V5 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Detailed fecal microbiome analyses revealed that MS patients had distinct microbial community profile compared to healthy controls. We observed an increased abundance of Psuedomonas, Mycoplana, Haemophilus, Blautia, and Dorea genera in MS patients, whereas control group showed increased abundance of Parabacteroides, Adlercreutzia and Prevotella genera. Thus our study is consistent with the hypothesis that MS patients have gut microbial dysbiosis and further study is needed to better understand their role in the etiopathogenesis of MS.},

abstract = {Academic research can offer insights for HCI practitioners, yet past work shows that research findings are rarely used in industry. We interviewed 22 design practitioners to identify why they do not use academic research and why and how they use other resources at work. We contribute recommendations for the design of translational resources to bridge the gap between theory and practice in HCI. We recommend ways to create theory-driven examples tailored to specific activities: understanding, brainstorming, building, and advocacy. Additionally, practitioners prefer actionable guidance and see prescriptive recommendations and downloadable design patterns as most useful. Design-oriented filters, support for mapping design challenges to research keywords, and visual galleries of examples from theory have the potential to facilitate designers' search processes. Finally, translational resources and discussion features can be integrated into tools for designers and academics to support cross-community collaboration.},

While numerous systems have been designed to support particular aspects of collective action, few systems support participatory, end-to-end collective action in which a crowd or community identifies opportunities, formulates goals, brainstorms ideas and develops plans, mobilizes, and takes action. To explore the possibilities and barriers in supporting such interactions, we introduce WeDo, a system aimed at promoting simple forms of participatory, end-to-end collective action. Pilot deployments of WeDo illustrate that sociotechnical systems can support automated transitions through different phases of end-to-end collective action, but that challenges, such as the elicitation of leadership and the accommodation of existing group norms, remain.},

In the online community Newgrounds, hundreds of collaborative animation projects called “collabs” are started each year, but less than 20{\%} are completed. We suggest that many collabs fail because leaders are overburdened and lack adequate technological support. We introduce Pipeline, a collaboration tool designed to support and transform leadership, with the goal of easing the burden on leaders of online creative projects. Through a case study of a six-week, 30-artist collaboration called Holiday Flood, we show how Pipeline supported redistributed leadership.

We study the problem in the bit probe model and analyse the number of bits read and written to perform the operations, both in the worst-case and in the average-case.

A counter is space-optimal if it represents any integer in the range [0, ⋯,2 n -1] using exactly n bits. We provide a space-optimal counter which supports increment and decrement operations by reading at most n-1 bits and writing at most 3 bits in the worst-case. This is the first space-optimal representation which supports these operations by always reading strictly less than n bits. For redundant counters where we only need to represent integers in the range [0,⋯,L-1]  for some integer L {\textless} 2 n  using n bits, we define the space-efficiency of the counter as the ratio L/2 n . We provide representations that achieve different trade-offs between the read/write-complexity and the efficiency.

abstract = {Abstract:
Users often don't follow expert advice for staying secure online, but the reasons for users' non-compliance are only partly understood. While some experts express frustration with users for ignoring existing advice, others argue that the advice itself is part of the problem. To inform this debate, we surveyed 231 security experts and asked, “What are the top 3 pieces of advice you would give to a non-tech-savvy user to protect their security online?” We received 152 unique pieces of advice -- all in at least one expert's top 3 -- that span 15 categories. These results suggest that, although individual experts give thoughtful, reasonable answers, the expert community as a whole lacks consensus on the most important advice to give. We conclude with a call to action for usability and security experts to work toward a prioritized, concise set of security advice that users can more easily consume and follow},

abstract = {At Google, experimentation is practically a mantra; we evaluate almost every change that potentially affects what our users experi- ence. Such changes include not only obvious user-visible changes such as modifications to a user interface, but also more subtle changes such as different machine learning algorithms that might affect rank- ing or content selection. Our insatiable appetite for experimenta- tion has led us to tackle the problems of how to run more experi- ments, how to run experiments that produce better decisions, and howto run them faster. In this paper, we describe Google's overlap- ping experiment infrastructure that is a key component to solving these problems. In addition, because an experiment infrastructure alone is insufficient, we also discuss the associated tools and ed- ucational processes required to use it effectively. We conclude by describing trends that show the success of this overall experimental environment. While the paper specifically describes the experiment system and experimental processes we have in place at Google, we believe they can be generalized and applied by any entity interested in using experimentation to improve search engines and other web applications.},

abstract = {OPINION STATEMENT: The gut microbiome is made up of a wide range of (chiefly) bacterial species that colonize the small and large intestine. The human gut microbiome contains a subset of thousands of bacterial species, with up to 10(14) total bacteria. Studies examining this bacterial content have shown wide variations in which species are present between individuals. The gut microbiome has been shown to have profound effects on the development and maintenance of immune system in both animal models and in humans. A growing body of evidence has implicated the human gut microbiome in a range of disorders, including obesity, inflammatory bowel diseases, and cardiovascular disease. Animal studies present compelling evidence that the gut microbiome plays a significant role in the progression of demyelinating disease, and that modulation of the microbiome can lead to either exacerbation or amelioration of symptoms. Differences in diet, vitamin D insufficiency, smoking, and alcohol use have all been implicated as risk factors in MS, and all have the ability to affect the composition of the gut microbiota. Preliminary clinical trials aimed at modulating the gut microbiota in MS patients are underway and may prove to be a promising and lower-risk treatment option in the future.},

The aim is to clarify Camus's reactions to the problems of absurdity, nihilism, and transcendence through an analysis of his literary and philosophical engagement with Dostoevsky. I make three related claims. First, I claim that Camus's philosophy of revolt is informed in crucial ways by Dostoevsky's accounts of religious transcendence and political nihilism. Second, that Camus's conceptualization of the tension between nihilism and transcendence corresponds to and is personified by the dialogue between Ivan Karamazov and Father Zossima in Dostoevsky's {\textless}italic{\textgreater}The Brothers Karamazov{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} . Finally, that Camus uses his novel {\textless}italic{\textgreater}The Plague{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} to bridge the moral and metaphysical divide between these two characters. In particular, I argue that Camus offers a distinct vision of revolt in {\textless}italic{\textgreater}The Plague{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} , which clarifies both the practical implications of revolt and his philosophical rejoinder to Dostoevsky. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

Here we use 16S rRNA sequencing to investigate the gut microbiome in subjects with multiple sclerosis (MS, n=60) and healthy controls (n=43). Microbiome alterations in MS include increases in Methanobrevibacter and Akkermansia and decreases in Butyricimonas, and correlate with variations in the expression of genes involved in dendritic cell maturation, interferon signalling and NF-kB signalling pathways in circulating T cells and monocytes. Patients on disease-modifying treatment show increased abundances of Prevotella and Sutterella, and decreased Sarcina, compared with untreated patients. MS patients of a second cohort show elevated breath methane compared with controls, consistent with our observation of increased gut Methanobrevibacter in MS in the first cohort. Further study is required to assess whether the observed alterations in the gut microbiome play a role in, or are a consequence of, MS pathogenesis.},

In this article, we expand this vision with the goal of enabling everyone, regardless of their expertise, to use biochips for their own personal purposes. We developed OpenDrop, an integrated electromicrofluidic platform that allows users to develop and program their own bio-applications. We address the main challenges that users may encounter: accessibility, bio-protocol design and interaction with microfluidics. OpenDrop consists of a do-it-yourself biochip, an automated software tool with visual interface and a detailed technique for at-home operations of microfluidics. We report on two years of use of OpenDrop, released as an open-source platform. Our platform attracted a highly diverse user base with participants originating from maker communities, academia and industry. Our findings show that 47{\%} of attempts to replicate OpenDrop were successful, the main challenge remaining the assembly of the device. In terms of usability, the users managed to operate their platforms at home and are working on designing their own bio-applications. Our work provides a step towards a future in which everyone will be able to create microfluidic devices for their personal applications, thereby democratizing parts of health care.},

Although alcohol abuse and nutrition play a central role for disease pathogenesis, preclinical models support a contribution of the gut microbiota to ALD and NAFLD. This review describes changes in the intestinal microbiota compositions related to ALD and NAFLD. Findings from in vitro, animal and human studies are used to explain how intestinal pathology contributes to disease progression. It summarizes the effects of untargeted microbiome modifications using antibiotics and probiotics on liver disease in animals and humans. While both affect humoral inflammation, the regression of advanced liver disease or mortality has not yet been demonstrated. The review further describes products secreted by Lactobacillus and microbiota-derived metabolites, such as fatty acids and antioxidants, that could be used for precision medicine in the treatment of liver disease. Better understanding of host-microbial interactions is now allowing discovery of novel therapeutic targets in the gut microbiota, enabling new treatment options that restore the intestinal ecosystem precisely and influence liver disease. The presented modulation options of the gut microbiota and precision medicine employing the gut microbiota have excellent prospects to improve liver disease treatment.},

Disturbance of its homeostasis can result in disease. We review factors that disrupt intestinal homeostasis and contribute to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), steatohepatitis (NASH), alcoholic liver disease, and cirrhosis. Liver disease has long been associated with qualitative and quantitative (overgrowth) dysbiotic changes in the intestinal microbiota. Extrinsic factors, such as the Western diet and alcohol, contribute to these changes. Dysbiosis results in intestinal inflammation, a breakdown of the intestinal barrier, and translocation of microbial products in animal models. However, the contribution of the intestinal microbiome to liver disease goes beyond simple translocation of bacterial products that promote hepatic injury and inflammation. Microbial metabolites produced in a dysbiotic intestinal environment and host factors are equally important in the pathogenesis of liver disease. We review how the combination of liver insult and disruptions in intestinal homeostasis contribute to liver disease. },

abstract = {Today's conversational agents are restricted to simple standalone commands. In this paper, we present Iris, an agent that draws on human conversational strategies to combine commands, allowing it to perform more complex tasks that it has not been explicitly designed to support: for example, composing one command to "plot a histogram" with another to first "log-transform the data". To enable this complexity, we introduce a domain specific language that transforms commands into automata that Iris can compose, sequence, and execute dynamically by interacting with a user through natural language, as well as a conversational type system that manages what kinds of commands can be combined. We have designed Iris to help users with data science tasks, a domain that requires support for command combination. In evaluation, we find that data scientists complete a predictive modeling task significantly faster (2.6 times speedup) with Iris than a modern non-conversational programming environment. Iris supports the same kinds of commands as today's agents, but empowers users to weave together these commands to accomplish complex goals.},

Differing dropout rates between treatment arms is sometimes called differential dropout or attrition. Although differential dropout can bias results, it does not always do so. Similarly, equal dropout may or may not lead to biased results. Depending on the type of missingness and the analysis used, one can get a biased estimate of the treatment effect with equal dropout rates and an unbiased estimate with unequal dropout rates.We reinforce this point with data from a randomised controlled trial in patients with renal cancer and a simulation study.},

However, it is an open question whether the success of Wikipedia results from a wisdom of crowds type of effect in which a large number of people each make a small number of edits, or whether it is driven by a core group of elite users who do the lions share of the work. In this study we examined how the influence of elite vs. common users changed over time in Wikipedia. The results suggest that although Wikipedia was driven by the influence of elite users early on, more recently there has been a dramatic shift in workload to the common user. We also show the same shift in del.icio.us, a very different type of social collaborative knowledge system. We discuss how these results mirror the dynamics found in more traditional social collectives, and how they can influence the design of new collaborative knowledge systems.},

Previous work has shown that a small fraction of editors -Wikipedians - do most of the work and produce most of the value. Other work has offered conjectures about how Wikipedians differ from other editors and how Wikipedians change over time. We quantify and test these conjectures. Our key findings include: Wikipedians' edits last longer; Wikipedians invoke community norms more often to justify their edits; on many dimensions of activity, Wikipedians start intensely, tail off a little, then maintain a relatively high level of activity over the course of their career. Finally, we show that the amount of work done by Wikipedians and non-Wikipedians differs significantly from their very first day. Our results suggest a design opportunity: customizing the initial user experience to improve retention and channel new users' intense energy.},

Communities with many joint memberships may struggle to get enough of their members' time and attention, but find it easy to import best practices from other communities. In this paper, we study the effects of membership overlap on the survival of online communities. By analyzing the historical data of 5673 Wikia communities, we find that higher levels of membership overlap are positively associated with higher survival rates of online communities. Furthermore, we find that it is beneficial for young communities to have shared members who play a central role in other mature communities. Our contributions are two-fold. Theoretically, by examining the impact of membership overlap on the survival of online communities we identified an important mechanism underlying the success of online communities. Practically, our findings may guide community creators on how to effectively manage their members, and tool designers on how to support this task.},

However, finding such “outside-the-box” inspirations is difficult, particularly in large idea repositories such as the web, because without guidance people select domains to search based on surface similarity to the problem's domain. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach in which non-experts identify domains that have the potential to yield useful and nonobvious inspirations for solutions. We report an empirical study demonstrating how crowds can generate domains of expertise and that showing people an abstract representation rather than the original problem helps them identify more distant domains. Crowd workers drawing inspirations from the distant domains produced more creative solutions to the original problem than did those who sought inspiration on their own, or drew inspiration from domains closer to or not sharing structural correspondence with the original problem.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing offers a powerful new paradigm for online work. However, real world tasks are often interdependent, requiring a big picture view of the difference pieces involved. Existing crowdsourcing approaches that support such tasks —ranging fromWikipedia to flash teams—are bottlenecked by relying on a small number of individuals to maintain the big picture. In this paper, we explore the idea that a com- putational system can scaffold an emerging interdependent, big picture view entirely through the small contributions of individuals, each of whom sees only a part of the whole. To investigate the viability, strengths, and weaknesses of this ap- proach we instantiate the idea in a prototype system for ac- complishing distributed information synthesis and evaluate its output across a variety of topics. We also contribute a set of design patterns that may be informative for other systems aimed at supporting big picture thinking in small pieces. Author},

abstract = {Online production groups have the potential to transform the way that knowledge is produced and disseminated. One of the most widely used forms of online production is the wiki, which has been used in domains ranging from science to education to enterprise. We examined the development of and interactions between coordination and conflict in a sample of 6811 wiki production groups. We investigated the influence of four coordination mechanisms: intra-article communication, inter-user communication, concentration of workgroup structure, and policy and procedures. We also examined the growth of conflict, finding the density of users in an information space to be a significant predictor. Finally, we analyzed the effectiveness of the four coordination mechanisms on managing conflict, finding differences in how each scaled to large numbers of contributors. Our results suggest that coordination mechanisms effective for managing conflict are not always the same as those effective for managing task quality, and that designers must take into account the social benefits of coordination mechanisms in addition to their production benefits.},

abstract = {Any system designed for people to use should be (a) easy to learn; (b) useful, i.e., contain functions people really need in their work; (c) easy to use; and (d) pleasant to use. In this note we present theoretical considerations and empirical data relevant to attaining these goals. First, we mention four principles for system design which we believe are necessary to attain these goals; Then we present survey results that demonstrate that our principles are not really all that obvious, but just seem obvious once presented. The responses of designers suggest they may sometimes think they are doing what we recommend when in fact they are not. This is consistent with the experience that systems designers do not often recommend or use them themselves. We contrast some of these responses with what we have in mind in order to provide a more useful description of our principles. Lastly, we consider why this might be so. These sections are summaries of those in a longer paper to appear elsewhere (Gould {\&} Lewis, 1983). In that paper we elaborate on our four principles, showing how they form the basis for a general methodology of design, and we describe a successful example of using them in actual system design (IBM's Audio Distribution System).},

Unfortunately, finding these answers is still quite difficult, since users' textual queries are often incomplete, imprecise, or use different vocabularies to describe the same problem. We present LemonAid, a new approach to help that allows users to find help by instead selecting a label, widget, link, image or other user interface (UI) element that they believe is relevant to their problem. LemonAid uses this selection to retrieve previously asked questions and their corresponding answers. The key insight that makes LemonAid work is that users tend to make similar selections in the interface for similar help needs and different selections for different help needs. Our initial evaluation shows that across a corpus of dozens of tasks and thousands of requests, LemonAid retrieved a result for 90{\%} of help requests based on UI selections and, of those, over half had relevant matches in the top 2 results.},

However, the appropriateness of this approach is under increasing criticism, with statisticians, economists, and psychologists arguing against the use of routine interpretation of results using "canned" p values. Three problems with current practice - the fallacy of the transposed conditional, a neglect of power, and the reluctance to interpret the size of effects - can lead us to build weak theories based on vaguely specified hypothesis, resulting in empirical studies which produce results that are of limited practical or scientific use. Using publicly available data presented at CHI 2010 [19] as an example we address each of the three concerns and promote consideration of the magnitude and actual importance of effects, as opposed to statistical significance, as the new criteria for evaluating CHI research.},

abstract = {Self-monitoring is a powerful means for self-reflection, which is important in health behavior change. More recently, researchers and companies began to offer numerous self-monitoring technologies for health. However, people-even experienced self-trackers such as Quantified-Selfers-have difficulty with continued tracking and gaining insights from their personal data. The goal of this dissertation is to provide insights on designing effective self-monitoring technology. In particular, I examine ways to support easy capturing of data and create persuasive feedback to nudge people toward positive behaviors. As part of this research, I introduce a mobile self-monitoring technology, SleepTight, a lightweight self-monitoring application widget that helps people capture and reflect on sleep behaviors. The SleepTight system was designed based on two formative studies and theories of reactivity in self-monitoring research. I leveraged the Android platform's lock screen and home screen widgets to lower the capture burden and increase awareness. I conducted a 4-week deployment study to evaluate the efficacy of the SleepTight system and found that SleepTight's widgets served as visual reminders and helped participants collect more data, more accurately. Participants were also able to reflect on sleeping patterns and relationships among the captured factors. I further examine effective ways to provide self-monitoring feedback by leveraging the Framing effects with an aim to nudge people toward positive health behaviors. The goal of self-monitoring is not simply to quantify individuals' behaviors, but to improve it. Therefore, self-monitoring feedback needs to convey information to help people make health-enhancing, self-beneficial decisions. To identify the type of framing that could best convey self-monitoring feedback, I conducted an online experiment to test the effects of three types of performance feedback framing-(1) valence, (2) presentation type, and (3) data unit-on individuals' self-efficacy. I identified that it is better to use a positive framing with data units (e.g., raw data, rate, percentage) that can increase the perception of one's performance capabilities to enhance individuals' self-efficacy. This work provides empirical guidance for creating influential, persuasive performance feedback, thereby helping people designing self-monitoring technologies to promote healthy behaviors. In this dissertation, I discuss how we can successfully design self-monitoring technology to help people collect data easily, learn their behavioral patterns, and develop positive changes for improving health. Effective self-monitoring technology eases the capture burden, supports customization, prevents backfilling, and provides feedback in a positive light. Self-monitoring technology that adheres to these guidelines can enhance tracking adherence, data accuracy, data awareness, self-reflection, and self-efficacy. I verify these thesis statements through a mixed-method approach including formative studies, technology deployment study, and experimental study. This dissertation research expands our knowledge of how consumer health information technology should be designed to support self-monitoring and reflection. Once a motivated individual meets a well-designed self-monitoring technology, exciting possibilities will arise for gaining insights for health, wellness, and other aspects of life.

Many questions have been answered only in part, or have been left unanswered. How common is this practice? Is it more common among certain nationalities? What have been the predominant medical fields in which self-experimentation has occurred? How dangerous an act has this proved to be? What have been the trends over time? What is the future likely to bring?From the available literature, I identified and analyzed 465 documented instances of this practice, performed over the course of the past 2 centuries. Most instances occurred in the United States. The peak of self-experimentation occurred in the first half of the 20th century. Eight deaths were recorded. A number of the investigators enjoyed successful careers, including the receipt of Nobel Prizes. Although self-experimentation by physicians and other biological scientists appears to be in decline, the courage of those involved and the benefits to society cannot be denied.},

abstract = {Personal informatics, the trend in collecting and analyz-ing data about one's own self, has been heavily influenced by the involvement of technology in our daily lives. In this paper we aim to understand what happens when novice self-experimenters are provided with a structured lesson in experimental design. We conducted a month-long study on self-experimentation, where twenty students in a seminar performed a self-experiment of their choice. The students were prepared with background readings and lessons on statistical analysis and experimental de-sign. Their experiments were designed in a structured manner: a specified number of variables to track and a set duration for the study. We also analyze videos of self-experimenters from the Quantified Self community, and compare them to the methods and outcomes used by the students. We find pitfalls that both students and self-motivated Quantified-Selfers experience, such as a too short duration of the study and insufficient planning of the set up of the experiment. Based on these findings, we propose an iterative self-experiment design method that addresses those pitfalls. We also discuss broader implications for future self-experimenters and designers of tools for self-experimentation.},

abstract = {Researchers have studied how people use self-tracking technologies and discovered a long list of barriers including lack of time and motivation as well as difficulty in data integration and interpretation. Despite the barriers, an increasing number of Quantified-Selfers diligently track many kinds of data about themselves, and some of them share their best practices and mistakes through Meetup talks, blogging, and conferences. In this work, we aim to gain insights from these "extreme users," who have used existing technologies and built their own workarounds to overcome different barriers. We conducted a qualitative and quantitative analysis of 52 video recordings of Quantified Self Meetup talks to understand what they did, how they did it, and what they learned. We highlight several common pitfalls to self-tracking, including tracking too many things, not tracking triggers and context, and insufficient scientific rigor. We identify future research efforts that could help make progress toward addressing these pitfalls. We also discuss how our findings can have broad implications in designing and developing self-tracking technologies.},

abstract = {ALS is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with no effective treatment. In the present study, we found that daily doses of lithium, leading to plasma levels ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 mEq/liter, delay disease progression in human patients affected by ALS. None of the patients treated with lithium died during the 15 months of the follow-up, and disease progression was markedly attenuated when compared with age-, disease duration-, and sex-matched control patients treated with riluzole for the same amount of time. In a parallel study on a genetic ALS animal model, the G93A mouse, we found a marked neuroprotection by lithium, which delayed disease onset and duration and augmented the life span. These effects were concomitant with activation of autophagy and an increase in the number of the mitochondria in motor neurons and suppressed reactive astrogliosis. Again, lithium reduced the slow necrosis characterized by mitochondrial vacuolization and increased the number of neurons counted in lamina VII that were severely affected in saline-treated G93A mice. After lithium administration in G93A mice, the number of these neurons was higher even when compared with saline-treated WT. All these mechanisms may contribute to the effects of lithium, and these results offer a promising perspective for the treatment of human patients affected by ALS.},

We found that, in almost all cases, subjects were more engaged and played longer when the game was easier, which seems to contradict the generality of the Inverted-U Hypothesis. Troublingly, we also found that the most engaging design conditions produced the slowest rates of learning. Based on our findings, we describe several design implications that may increase challenge-seeking in games, such as providing feedforward about the anticipated degree of challenge.},

abstract = {Realtime crowdsourcing research has demonstrated that it is possible to recruit paid crowds within seconds by managing a small, fast-reacting worker pool. Realtime crowds enable crowd-powered systems that respond at interactive speeds: for example, cameras, robots and instant opinion polls. So far, these techniques have mainly been proof-of-concept prototypes: research has not yet attempted to understand how they might work at large scale or optimize their cost/performance trade-offs. In this paper, we use queueing theory to analyze the retainer model for realtime crowdsourcing, in particular its expected wait time and cost to requesters. We provide an algorithm that allows requesters to minimize their cost subject to performance requirements. We then propose and analyze three techniques to improve performance: push notifications, shared retainer pools, and precruitment, which involves recalling retainer workers before a task actually arrives. An experimental validation finds that precruited workers begin a task 500 milliseconds after it is posted, delivering results below the one-second cognitive threshold for an end-user to stay in flow.},

abstract = {Crowd-powered systems combine computation with human intelligence, drawn from large groups of people connecting and coordinating online. These hybrid systems en- able applications and experiences that neither crowds nor computation could support alone. Unfortunately, crowd work is error-prone and slow, making it dicult to incor- porate crowds as rst-order building blocks in software systems. I introduce com- putational techniques that decompose complex tasks into simpler, veri able steps to improve quality, and optimize work to return results in seconds. These techniques develop crowdsourcing as a platform so that it is reliable and responsive enough to be used in interactive systems. This thesis develops these ideas through a series of crowd-powered systems. The rst, Soylent, is a word processor that uses paid micro-contributions to aid writing tasks such as text shortening and proofreading. Using Soylent is like having access to an entire editorial sta as you write. The second system, Adrenaline, is a camera that uses crowds to help amateur photographers capture the exact right moment for a photo. It nds the best smile and catches subjects in mid-air jumps, all in realtime. Moving beyond generic knowledge and paid crowds, I introduce techniques to motivate a social network that has speci c expertise, and techniques to data mine crowd activity traces in support of a large number of uncommon user goals. These systems point to a future where social and crowd intelligence are central elements of interaction, software, and computation},

abstract = {Summary Elevated postprandial blood glucose levels constitute a global epidemic and a major risk factor for prediabetes and type II diabetes, but existing dietary methods for controlling them have limited efficacy. Here, we continuously monitored week-long glucose levels in an 800-person cohort, measured responses to 46,898 meals, and found high variability in the response to identical meals, suggesting that universal dietary recommendations may have limited utility. We devised a machine-learning algorithm that integrates blood parameters, dietary habits, anthropometrics, physical activity, and gut microbiota measured in this cohort and showed that it accurately predicts personalized postprandial glycemic response to real-life meals. We validated these predictions in an independent 100-person cohort. Finally, a blinded randomized controlled dietary intervention based on this algorithm resulted in significantly lower postprandial responses and consistent alterations to gut microbiota configuration. Together, our results suggest that personalized diets may successfully modify elevated postprandial blood glucose and its metabolic consequences. Video Abstract},

abstract = {Genetic information contains a record of the history of our species, and technological advances have transformed our ability to access this record. Many studies have used genome-wide data from populations today to learn about the peopling of the globe and subsequent adaptation to local conditions. Implicit in this research is the assumption that the geographic locations of people today are informative about the geographic locations of their ancestors in the distant past. However, it is now clear that long-range migration, admixture, and population replacement subsequent to the initial out-of-Africa expansion have altered the genetic structure of most of the world's human populations. In light of this we argue that it is time to critically reevaluate current models of the peopling of the globe, as well as the importance of natural selection in determining the geographic distribution of phenotypes. We specifically highlight the transformative potential of ancient DNA. By accessing the genetic make-up of populations living at archaeologically known times and places, ancient DNA makes it possible to directly track migrations and responses to natural selection. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Papier-M{\^{a}}ch{\'{e}} introduces high-level abstractions for working with these input technologies that facilitate technology portability. We evaluated this toolkit through a laboratory study and longitudinal use in course and research projects, finding the input abstractions, technology portability, and monitoring facilities to be highly effective.},

Sleep-Coacher automates the cycle of single-case experiments by collecting raw mobile sensor data and generating per-sonalized, data-driven sleep recommendations based on a collection of template recommendations created with input from clinicians. The system guides users through iterative short experiments to test the effect of recommen-dations on their sleep. We evaluate SleepCoacher in two studies, measuring the effect of recommendations on the frequency of awakenings, self-reported restfulness, and sleep onset latency, concluding that it is effective: partici-pant sleep improves as adherence with SleepCoacher's rec-ommendations and experiment schedule increases. This approach presents computationally-enhanced interven-tions leveraging the capacity of a closed feedback loop system, offering a method for scaling guided single-case experiments in real time.},

abstract = {No longer just buzz words, “patient empowerment” and “data sharing” are enabling breakthrough research on rare genetic diseases. Although more than 100,000 genetic variants are believed to drive disease in humans, little is known about penetrance—the probability that a mutation will actually cause disease in the carrier. This conundrum persists because small sample sizes breed imperfect alliance estimates between mutations and disease risk. Now, a patient-turned-scientist joined with a large bioinformatics team to analyze vast amounts of shared data—from the Exome Aggregation Consortium and the 23andMe database—to provide insights into genetic-variant penetrance and possible treatment approaches for a rare, fatal genetic prion disease.More than 100,000 genetic variants are reported to cause Mendelian disease in humans, but the penetrance—the probability that a carrier of the purported disease-causing genotype will indeed develop the disease—is generally unknown. We assess the impact of variants in the prion protein gene (PRNP) on the risk of prion disease by analyzing 16,025 prion disease cases, 60,706 population control exomes, and 531,575 individuals genotyped by 23andMe Inc. We show that missense variants in PRNP previously reported to be pathogenic are at least 30 times more common in the population than expected on the basis of genetic prion disease prevalence. Although some of this excess can be attributed to benign variants falsely assigned as pathogenic, other variants have genuine effects on disease susceptibility but confer lifetime risks ranging from {\textless}0.1 to {\~{}}100{\%}. We also show that truncating variants in PRNP have position-dependent effects, with true loss-of-function alleles found in healthy older individuals, a finding that supports the safety of therapeutic suppression of prion protein expression.},

abstract = {Traditional medical fundraising charities have been relying on third-party watchdogs and carefully crafting their reputation over time to signal their credibility to potential donors. As medical fundraising campaigns migrate to online platforms in the form of crowdfunding, potential donors can no longer rely on the organization's traditional methods for achieving credibility. Individual fundraisers must establish credibility on their own. Potential donors, therefore, seek new factors to assess the credibility of crowdfunding campaigns. In this paper, we investigate current practices in assessing the credibility of online medical crowdfunding campaigns. We report results from a mixed-methods study that analyzed data from social media and semi-structured interviews. We discovered eleven factors associated with the perceived credibility of medical crowdfunding. Of these, three communicative/emotional factors were unique to medical crowdfunding. We also found a distinctive validation practice, the collective endorsement. Close-connections' online presence and external online communities come together to form this collective endorsement in online medical fundraising campaigns. We conclude by describing how fundraisers can leverage collective endorsements to improve their campaigns' perceived credibility},

This paper contributes a novel dimension to this field of study by examining if a hybrid computer-human SMS system can engage pregnant women in Kenya in health-related communication. Our approach leverages the different strengths of both the computer and the human. The computer automates the bulk-sending of personalized messages to patients, allowing the human to read patients' replies and respond to those in need of attention. Findings from a 12-month deployment with 100 women show that our approach is capable of engaging the majority of participants in health-related conversations. We show that receiving messages from the system triggers participant communication and the amount of communication increases as participants approach their expected due date. In addition, analysis of participants' messages shows that they often contain sensitive health information conveyed through a complex mixture of languages and ‘txting' abbreviations, all of which highlight the benefits of including a human in the workflow. Our findings are relevant for HCI researchers and practitioners interested in understanding or engaging underserved populations},

I explain that free innovation is an inherently simple, transaction-free, grassroots innovation process engaged in by tens of millions of people in the household sector of national economies. Unlike producer innovation, free innovation does not require intellectual property rights to function. Indeed, from the perspective of participants, free innovation is fundamentally not about money – it is about human flourishing. I spell out the economics of free innovation relative to producer innovation, and its major economic impacts. These are currently not measured and so hidden from view. I also develop and explore major implications of free innovation for innovation theory, policymaking, and practice.},

@article{Franke2014,
abstract = {In order to configure individual products according to their own preferences, customers are required to know what they want. While most research simply assumes that consumers have sufficient preference insight to do so, a number of psychologically oriented scholars have recently voiced serious concerns about this assumption. They argue that decades of consumer behavior research have shown that most consumers in most product categories lack this knowledge. Not knowing what one wants means being unable to specify what one wants-and therefore, they conclude, the majority of customers are unable to use configuration toolkits in a meaningful way. In essence, this would mean that mass customization should rather be termed 'niche customization' as it will be doomed to remain a concept for a very small minority of customers only. This pessimism stands in sharp contrast to the optimism of those who herald the new possibilities enabled by advances in communication and production technologies as the dawn of a new era in new product development and business in general. Which position is right? In order to answer this question, this research investigates the role of the configuration toolkit. Implicitly, the skeptic position assumes that the individual customers' knowledge (or absence of knowledge) of what they want is an exogenous and constant term that does not change during the interaction with the toolkit. However, learning theories suggest that the customers' trial-and-error interaction with the configuration toolkit and the feedback information they receive should increase their preference insight. If this was true and the effect size strong, it would mean that low a priori preference insight does not impede customers to derive value from mass customization. Three experiments show that configuration toolkits should be interpreted as learning instruments that allow consumers to understand their preferences more clearly. Even short trial-and-error self-design processes with conventional toolkits bring about substantial and time-stable enhancements of preference insight. The value of this knowledge is remarkable. In the product category of self-designed watches, the 10-minute design process resulted in additional preference insight worth 43.13 euros on average or +66{\%}, measured by incentive-compatible auctions. A moderator analysis in a representative sample shows that the learning effect is particularly strong among customers who initially exhibit low levels of preference insight. These findings entail three contributions. First, it becomes evident that the interaction with mass customization toolkits not only triggers affective reactions among customers but also has cognitive effects-a response category not investigated before. Second, it suggests that the pessimism regarding the mass appeal of these toolkits is not justified-mass customization has the potential to truly deserve its name. The prerequisite for this, and this normative conclusion is the final contribution, is that the toolkit should not be interpreted as a mere interface for conveying preexisting preferences to the producer. Rather, it should be treated as a learning instrument. Several suggestions are made for how firms employing this innovative business model could design their toolkits towards this end.

One approach is the development of technologies that provide real-time, continuous feedback of energy usage. However, there is one problem - most tech- nologies use a “one-size-fits-all” solution, providing the same feedback to differently motivated individuals at dif- ferent stages of readiness, willingness and ableness to change. In this paper, we synthesize a wide range of moti- vational psychology literature to develop a motivational framework based on the Transtheoretical (aka Stages of Behavior Change) Model. For each stage, we state the mo- tivational goal(s), and recommendation(s) for how technol- ogies can reach these goals. Each goal and recommendation is supported by a rationale based on motivational literature.

abstract = {Charles Lindblom's 1959 essay 'The Science of 'Muddling Through'' is best known for the strategy of decision making-disjointed incrementalism-that it recommended. That famous paper and Lindblom's related work also provided two theories: a critique of the conventional method (the synoptic approach) and an argument for using incrementalism instead. Both are applied theories: they are designed to help solve complex policy problems. Lindblom's negative applied theory has stood the test of time well: the empirical foundations of its main micro-component (cognitive constraints of individuals) and its central macro-component (the impact of preference conflict on policy making) have grown stronger since 1959. The picture regarding the positive applied theory is more mixed. As a coherent decision-making strategy, disjointed incrementalism has almost disappeared. Yet its key elements, the major heuristics identified in 'Muddling Through,' are thriving in many applied fields. Intriguingly, they are often accompanied by subroutines-especially optimization as a choice rule-typically associated with the synoptic approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since its initiation in 2005, the Harvard Personal Genome Project has enrolled thousands of volunteers interested in publicly sharing their genome, health and trait data. Because these data are highly identifiable, we use an 'open consent' framework that purposefully excludes promises about privacy and requires participants to demonstrate comprehension prior to enrollment.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: Our model of non-anonymous, public genomes has led us to a highly participatory model of researcher-participant communication and interaction. The participants, who are highly committed volunteers, self-pursue and donate research-relevant datasets, and are actively engaged in conversations with both our staff and other Personal Genome Project participants. We have quantitatively assessed these communications and donations, and report our experiences with returning research-grade whole genome data to participants. We also observe some of the community growth and discussion that has occurred related to our project.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY: We find that public non-anonymous data is valuable and leads to a participatory research model, which we encourage others to consider. The implementation of this model is greatly facilitated by web-based tools and methods and participant education. Project results are long-term proactive participant involvement and the growth of a community that benefits both researchers and participants.},

abstract = {In this paper, we reflect on self-tracking practices in the context of neoliberal ideologies – predominantly the quest for self-improvement as medi-ated by and affecting the individual. On the backdrop of Foucault's concept of governmentality and current academic research on the Quantified Self, we con-sider online accounts and reflections of people's self-tracking endeavours as they emerge from and exist in neoliberal frameworks. We will outline how they relate to and produce ideas of humanity as inherently risky, the construction of 'normality' based on individual parameters, as well as optimisation as a never ending impera-tive where new opportunities for improvement are paramount. Finally, we present and suggest ways of queering self-tracking in order to subvert and reconceptualise its practice in order to imagine and enable the emergence of different utopias.

New technologies for detailed biological profiling of individuals at the molecular level have been crucial in initiating the move to personalised medicine; further novel technologies will be necessary if the vision is to become a reality. We will need to develop new technologies to collect and analyse data in a way that is not just linear but integrated (understanding system level functioning) and dynamic (understanding system in flux). Key factors in the development of technologies for personalised medicine are standardisation, integration and harmonisation. For example, the tools and processes for data collection and analysis must be standardised across research sites. Research activity at different sites must be integrated to maximise synergies, and scientific research must be integrated with healthcare to ensure effective translation. There must also be harmonisation between scientific practices in different research sites, between science and healthcare and between science, healthcare and wider society, including the ethical and regulatory frameworks, the prevailing political and cultural ethos and the expectations of patients/citizens. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The flourishing of citizen science is an exciting phenomenon with the potential to contribute significantly to scientific progress. However, we lack a frame-work for addressing in a principled and effective manner the pressing ethical questions it raises. We argue that at the core of any such framework must be the human right to science. Moreover, we stress an almost entirely neglected dimension of this right—the entitlement it confers on all human beings to participate in the scientific process in all of its aspects. We then explore three of its key implications for the ethical regulation of citizen science: (a) the positive obligations imposed by the right on the state and other agents to recognize and promote citizen science, (b) the convective nature of the participation in science facilitated by the right and (c) the potential to mobilize the right in rolling back the unprecedented expansion of intellectual property regimes. From Thales of Miletus' geometrical theorems to Benjamin Franklin's lightning rod, the history of science is studded with the contributions of individuals who were not professional scientists in the contemporary sense. These intrepid amateurs made ob-servations, conducted experiments or devised methods of investigation that prompted major advances. By contrast, the professionalization and institutionalization of science did not get into full swing until well into the nineteenth century, and when it did so, it had the effect of crowding non-professionals out of the scientific enterprise. In recent decades, however, there has been a tremendous flowering of non-professional involvement in scientific research. This phenomenon has been dubbed citizen science (Bowser and Shanley 2013). Although the term lacks a precise and widely accepted definition, we take it to mean any form of active non-professional participation in science that goes beyond human subject research conducted by professional researchers. In both scope and format, citizen science traverses the full extent of scientific activity. Projects},

SETTING: PubMed, Embase, and Academic Search Premier searched for articles describing innovative approaches to randomized trial design and analysis methods and methods for conducting observational research in patients with rare diseases. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed information related to the proposed methods, the specific rare disease being studied, and outcomes from the application of the methods. We summarize methods with respect to their advantages in studying health outcomes in rare diseases and provide examples of their application. RESULTS: We identified 46 articles that proposed or described methods for studying patient health outcomes in rare diseases. Articles covered a wide range of rare diseases and most (72{\%}) were published in 2008 or later. We identified 16 research strategies for studying rare disease. Innovative clinical trial methods minimize sample size requirements (n=4) and maximize the proportion of patients who receive active treatment (n=2), strategies crucial to studying small populations of patients with limited treatment choices. No studies describing unique methods for conducting observational studies in patients with rare diseases were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Though numerous studies apply unique clinical trial designs and considerations to assess patient health outcomes in rare diseases, less attention has been paid to innovative methods for studying rare diseases using observational data.},

abstract = {Gamification combines the playful design and feedback mechanisms from games with users' social profiles (e.g. Facebook, twitter, and LinkedIn) in non-game applications. Successful gamification practices are reliant on encouraging playful subjectivities so that users voluntarily expose their personal information, which is then used to drive behavioural change (e.g. weight loss, workplace productivity, educational advancement, consumer loyalty, etc.). The pleasures of play, the promise of a 'game', and the desire to level up and win are used to inculcate desirable skill sets and behaviours. Gamification is rooted in surveillance; providing real-time feedback about users' actions by amassing large quantities of data and then simplifying this data into modes that easily understandable, such as progress bars, graphs and charts. This article provides an introduction to gamification for surveillance scholars. I first provide brief definitions of gamification, games and play, linking the effectiveness of gamification to the quantification of everyday life. I then explain how the quantification in gamification is different from the quantification in both analog spaces and digital non-game spaces. Next, I draw from governmentality studies to show how quantification is leveraged in terms of surveillance. I employ three examples to demonstrate the social effects and impacts of gamified behaviour. These examples range from using self-surveillance to gamify everyday life, to the participatory surveillance evoked by social networking services, to the hierarchical surveillance of the gamified call-centre. Importantly, the call-centre example becomes a limit case, emphasizing the inability to gamify all spaces, especially those framed by work and not play. This leads to my conclusion, arguing that without knowing first what games and play are, we cannot accurately respond to and critique the playful surveillant technologies leveraged by gamification.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Seventy percent of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) identify certain foods as triggers for their symptom flare-ups. To help identify potential trigger foods, practitioners often rely on patient food and gastrointestinal (GI) symptom journaling. The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility and usability of a novel food and symptom journal app, specifically designed for patients with IBS. Secondary aims were to explore the effect of using the app on GI symptoms and to describe associations between diet and GI symptoms suggested by individual patient data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The feasibility and usability of the novel app was studied in 11 IBS patients (8 women), aged 21-65 years. Participants were asked to log GI symptoms (abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation) using a 100-point color-graded sliding scale (green=none, red=severe) four times a day and to log every meal/snack they ate (at least three times a day) over a 2-week period. The app's feasibility as a data collection tool was evaluated by daily completion, compliance, data hoarding, and fatigability rates. Usability was evaluated with the System Usability Scale (SUS). To explore potential impact of using the app on bowel distress, we compared before and after intervention IBS-Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS) scores. Meal entries were analyzed for nutrients using the Nutrition Data System for Research. Regression analyses were conducted for each participant journal to explore relationships between meal nutrients and subsequent GI symptoms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Daily average completion rates of the minimum requested entries for meal and GI symptoms were 112±47{\%} and 78±44{\%}, respectively. Average 24-h compliance rates were 90±19{\%} and 94±12{\%}, respectively. The SUS score was above average (mean 83, range 65-97.5; n=10). Most participants did not have a clinically significant decrease in IBS-SSS. At least one strong association (P≤0.05) between GI symptoms and a meal nutrient was found in 73{\%} of participants. The mean number of associations was 2 (range 0-7; n=11). Patterns of associations differed between individual participants.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our app appeared to be a feasible and usable tool for IBS patients. Our findings are in line with anecdotes that most IBS patients have food triggers and that these vary by individual. Future studies can explore whether individualized dietary changes guided by an app can result in IBS symptom improvement.},

abstract = {Our understanding of cancer biology is rapidly increasing, as is the availability and affordability of high throughput technologies for comprehensive molecular characterization of tumors and the individual's own genetic makeup. Thus, the time is right to implement personalized molecular medicine for all patients with cancer. Personalized approaches span the full cancer care spectrum from risk stratification to prevention, screening, therapy, and survivorship programs. Several molecular therapeutics have entered clinical trials creating a huge opportunity to couple genomic markers with this emerging drug tool kit. The number of patients managed in major cancer centers creates a challenge to the implementation of genomic technologies required to successfully deliver on the promise of personalized cancer care. This requires a major investment in infrastructure to facilitate rapid deployment of multiplex, cost-effective, and tissue-sparing assays relevant across multiple tumor lineages in the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) environment. Efforts must be made to ensure that assays are accessible to patients most likely to be enrolled onto molecular-marker-driven trials and that the tests are billable and payable, which will make them accessible to a wide range of patients. As the number of patients and aberrations increase, it will become critical to provide decision support for genomic medicine. Institutional commitment is needed to optimize accessibility and quality of research biopsies and to facilitate novel personalized cancer therapy trials. This article will focus on the challenges and opportunities that accompany the building of infrastructure for personalized cancer therapy.},

abstract = {The rapid development of high-throughput technologies and computational frameworks enables the examination of biological systems in unprecedented detail. The ability to study biological phenomena at omics levels in turn is expected to lead to significant advances in personalized and precision medicine. Patients can be treated according to their own molecular characteristics. Individual omes as well as the integrated profiles of multiple omes, such as the genome, the epigenome, the transcriptome, the proteome, the metabolome, the antibodyome, and other omics information are expected to be valuable for health monitoring, preventative measures, and precision medicine. Moreover, omics technologies have the potential to transform medicine from traditional symptom-oriented diagnosis and treatment of diseases toward disease prevention and early diagnostics. We discuss here the advances and challenges in systems biology-powered personalized medicine at its current stage, as well as a prospective view of future personalized health care at the end of this review.},

These systems show physical activity information (e.g., step counts, energy expenditure, heart rate) which is sufficient for many self-knowledge needs, but information about the factors that affect physical activity may be needed for deeper self-reflection and increased self-knowledge. We explored the use of contextual information, such as events, places, and people, to support reflection on the factors that affect physical activity. We present three findings from our studies. First, users make associations between physical activity and contextual information that help them become aware of factors that affect their physical activity. Second, reflecting on physical activity and context can increase people's awareness of opportunities for physical activity. Lastly, automated tracking of physical activity and contextual information benefits long-term reflection, but may have detrimental effects on immediate awareness.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: About 6 million people search for health information on the Internet each day in the United States. Both patients and caregivers search for information about prescribed courses of treatments, unanswered questions after a visit to their providers, or diet and exercise regimens. Past literature has indicated potential challenges around quality in health information available on the Internet. However, diverse information exists on the Internet-ranging from government-initiated webpages to personal blog pages. Yet we do not fully understand the strengths and weaknesses of different types of information available on the Internet.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to investigate the strengths and challenges of various types of health information available online and to suggest what information sources best fit various question types.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We collected questions posted to and the responses they received from an online diabetes community and classified them according to Rothwell's classification of question types (fact, policy, or value questions). We selected 60 questions (20 each of fact, policy, and value) and the replies the questions received from the community. We then searched for responses to the same questions using a search engine and recorded the$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Community responses answered more questions than did search results overall. Search results were most effective in answering value questions and least effective in answering policy questions. Community responses answered questions across question types at an equivalent rate, but most answered policy questions and the least answered fact questions. Value questions were most answered by community responses, but some of these answers provided by the community were incorrect. Fact question search results were the most clinically valid.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The Internet is a prevalent source of health information for people. The information quality people encounter online can have a large impact on them. We present what kinds of questions people ask online and the advantages and disadvantages of various information sources in getting answers to those questions. This study contributes to addressing people's online health information needs.},

abstract = {Background: Online health community (OHC) moderators help facilitate conversations and provide information to members. However, the necessity of the moderator in helping members achieve goals by providing the support they need remains unclear, with some prior research suggesting that moderation is unnecessary or even harmful for close-knit OHCs. Similarly, members' perceptions of moderator roles are underexplored. Starting January of 2013, WebMD moderators stopped working for WebMD communities. This event provided an opportunity for us to study the perceived role of moderators in OHCs. Objective: We examine the OHC members' perception on OHC moderators by studying their reactions toward the departure of moderators in their communities. We also analyzed the relative posting activity on OHCs before and after the departure of moderators from the communities among all members and those who discussed moderators' departures. Methods: We applied a mixed-methods approach to study the posts of all 55 moderated WebMD communities by querying the terms relating to discussions surrounding moderators' disappearance from the WebMD community. We performed open and axial coding and affinity diagramming to thematically analyze patients' reactions to the disappeared moderators. The number of posts and poster groups (members and moderators) were analyzed over time to understand posting patterns around moderators' departure. Results: Of 821 posts retrieved under 95 threads, a total of 166 open codes were generated. The codes were then grouped into 2 main themes with 6 total subthemes. First, patients attempted to understand why moderators had left and what could be done to fill the void left by the missing moderators. During these discussions, the posts revealed that patients believed that moderators played critical roles in the communities by making the communities vibrant and healthy, finding solutions, and giving medical information. Some patients felt personally attached with moderators, expressing they would cease their community participation. On the other hand, patients also indicated that moderators were not useful or sometimes even harmful for peer interactions. The overall communities' posting activity, which was already in decline, showed no significant difference before and after the moderators' departure. In fact, the overall posting activities of the communities were declining well before the moderators' departure. These declining posting activities might be the reason why WebMD removed the moderators. Conclusion: Compassionate moderators who provide medical expertise, control destructive member posts, and help answer questions can provide important support for patient engagement in OHCs. Moderators are in general received positively by community members and do not appear to interfere with peer interactions. Members are well aware of the possibility of misinformation spreading in OHCs. Further investigation into the attitudes of less vocal community members should be conducted.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients increasingly use online health communities to exchange health information and peer support. During the progression of health discussions, a change of topic-topic drift-can occur. Topic drift is a frequent phenomenon linked to incoherence and frustration in online communities and other forms of computer-mediated communication. For sensitive topics, such as health, such drift could have life-altering repercussions, yet topic drift has not been studied in these contexts. OBJECTIVE Our goals were to understand topic drift in online health communities and then to develop and evaluate an automated approach to detect both topic drift and efforts of community members to counteract such drift. METHODS We manually analyzed 721 posts from 184 threads from 7 online health communities within WebMD to understand topic drift, members' reaction towards topic drift, and their efforts to counteract topic drift. Then, we developed an automated approach to detect topic drift and counteraction efforts. We detected topic drift by calculating cosine similarity between 229,156 posts from 37,805 threads and measuring change of cosine similarity scores from the threads' first posts to their sequential posts. Using a similar approach, we detected counteractions to topic drift in threads by focusing on the irregular increase of similarity scores compared to the previous post in threads. Finally, we evaluated the performance of our automated approaches to detect topic drift and counteracting efforts by using a manually developed gold standard. RESULTS Our qualitative analyses revealed that in threads of online health communities, topics change gradually, but usually stay within the global frame of topics for the specific community. Members showed frustration when topic drift occurred in the middle of threads but reacted positively to off-topic stories shared as separate threads. Although all types of members helped to counteract topic drift, original posters provided the most effort to keep threads on topic. Cosine similarity scores show promise for automatically detecting topical changes in online health discussions. In our manual evaluation, we achieved an F1 score of .71 and .73 for detecting topic drift and counteracting efforts to stay on topic, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Our analyses expand our understanding of topic drift in a health context and highlight practical implications, such as promoting off-topic discussions as a function of building rapport in online health communities. Furthermore, the quantitative findings suggest that an automated tool could help detect topic drift, support counteraction efforts to bring the conversation back on topic, and improve communication in these important communities. Findings from this study have the potential to reduce topic drift and improve online health community members' experience of computer-mediated communication. Improved communication could enhance the personal health management of members who seek essential information and support during times of difficulty.},

To address this, we conducted surveys and interviews with people who collect and reflect on personal information. We derived a stage-based model of personal informatics systems composed of five stages (preparation, collection, integration, reflection, and action) and identified barriers in each of the stages. These stages have four essential properties: barriers cascade to later stages; they are iterative; they are user-driven and/or system-driven; and they are uni-faceted or multi-faceted. From these properties, we recommend that personal informatics systems should 1) be designed in a holistic manner across the stages; 2) allow iteration between stages; 3) apply an appropriate balance of automated technology and user control within each stage to facilitate the user experience; and 4) explore support for associating multiple facets of people's lives to enrich the value of systems.},

abstract = {Based on a collaborative symposium in 2014 hosted by the Society of Behavioral Medicine (SBM) and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), this paper presents a model for physical activity counseling for primary care physicians (PCPs). Most US adults do not meet national recommendations for physical activity levels. Socioecological factors drive differences in physical activity levels by geography, sex, age, and racial/ethnic group. The recent Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act incentivizes PCPs to offer patients physical activity counseling. However, PCPs have reported socioecological barriers to physical activity counseling and also patient barriers to physical activity, spanning from the individual to the environmental (eg, lack of safe spaces for physical activity), policy (eg, reimbursement policies), and organizational (eg, electronic medical record protocols, worksite norms/policies) levels. The aims of this paper are to: 1) discuss barriers to PCP counseling for physical activity; 2) provide evidence-based strategies and techniques to help PCPs address these counseling barriers; and 3) suggest practical steps for PCPs to counsel patients on physical activity using strategies and supports from policy, the primary care team, and other support networks.},

abstract = {Over the past 2 decades, great strides have been made in analyzing the cognitive processes involved in learning and instruction. During the same period, however, attention to motivational issues has been minimal. It is now time to redress this imbalance. As Bruner (1966) has put the case: The will to learn is an intrinsic motive, one that finds both its source and its reward in its own exercise. The will to learn becomes the problem only under specialized circumstances like those of a school, where a curriculum is set, students confined and a path fixed. The problem exists not so much in learning itself, but in the fact that what the school imposes often fails to enlist the natural energies that sustain spontaneous learning. (p. 127) In fact, it seems a frequent assumption about schools that learning is boring and unpleasant drudgery-somethingone endures only to avoid punishment or to achieve some external goal, such as a good grade-point average or a high-paying job (Jackson, 1968; Lepper, 1983). This need not be the case. In this chapter, we summarize and extend earlier work by Malone (1981a, 1981b) concerning the design of instructional environments that are intrinsically motivating, that is, environments in which people are motivated to learn in the absence of obvious external rewards or punishments.},

abstract = {To evaluate sustained improvements 6 months after a 40-session, in-school computer attention training intervention using neurofeedback or cognitive training (CT) administered to 7- to 11-year-olds with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). One hundred four children were randomly assigned to receive neurofeedback, CT, or a control condition and were evaluated 6 months postintervention. A 3-point growth model assessed change over time across the conditions on the Conners 3-Parent Assessment Report (Conners 3-P), the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function Parent Form (BRIEF), and a systematic double-blinded classroom observation (Behavioral Observation of Students in Schools). Analysis of variance assessed community-initiated changes in stimulant medication. Parent response rates were 90{\%} at the 6-month follow-up. Six months postintervention, neurofeedback participants maintained significant gains on Conners 3-P (Inattention effect size [ES] = 0.34, Executive Functioning ES = 0.25, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity ES = 0.23) and BRIEF subscales including the Global Executive Composite (ES = 0.31), which remained significantly greater than gains found among children in CT and control conditions. Children in the CT condition showed delayed improvement over immediate postintervention ratings only on Conners 3-P Executive Functioning (ES = 0.18) and 2 BRIEF subscales. At the 6-month follow-up, neurofeedback participants maintained the same stimulant medication dosage, whereas participants in both CT and control conditions showed statistically and clinically significant increases (9 mg [P = .002] and 13 mg [P {\textless} .001], respectively). Neurofeedback participants made more prompt and greater improvements in ADHD symptoms, which were sustained at the 6-month follow-up, than did CT participants or those in the control group.

abstract = {Background: Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects 1 {\%} of the world's population, including 600,000 people in France. Persons with schizophrenia (PWS) have excess mortality (their life expectancy is reduced by 20 {\%}) and excess morbidity. In addition, such persons may have a large number of missing or decayed teeth. Dental caries and periodontal measurement indexes are often twice as high as the level found in the general population. Poor oral health can also affect quality of life and oral health is inseparable from general health. The management of oral health problems needs a multidisciplinary approach. According to the World Health Organization, the aim of therapeutic education (TE) is to help patients take care of themselves and to improve empowerment and recovery. In this educational approach, it is important to take into account the patient's personal experience. Though rarely investigated, the personal experience of PWS in oral health quality of life (OHRQoL) must be used to build a therapeutic educational programme in oral health (TEPOH) in a multidisciplinary approach, and the effectiveness of this program must be evaluated. Methods/design: We report the protocol of a randomized controlled cluster study. This study will be conducted in twelve hospitals in France. We hypothesized that a decrease of 20 {\%} in the proportion of patients with CPI ≥ 3 would establish the effectiveness of TEPOH. Therefore, 12 hospitals will be randomly allocated to either TEPOH or no TEPOH. Altogether, they will have to recruit 230 PWS, who will be randomly allocated with a ratio of 1:1 to one of two conditions: control without intervention versus the group benefitting from TEPOH. Discussion: If successful, the study will generate methodologically sound results that provide knowledge on the effectiveness of a TEP in oral health for PWS. The results can be used to promote OHRQoL in a global health approach and develop appropriate strategies to encourage and facilitate financial support for healthcare, the multidisciplinary treatment of dental disorders, and the development of training in oral and mental health for caregivers.

Recent studies with col-lege student populations have examined the feasibility of collecting everyday mood, activity, and social data. How-ever, these studies do not account for students' experiences and challenges adopting self-tracking technologies to sup-port mental wellness goals. We present two studies con-ducted to better understand self-tracking for stress management and mental wellness in student populations. First, focus groups and card sorting activities with 14 student health professionals reveal expert perspectives on the useful-ness of tracking for three scenarios. Second, an online survey of 297 students examines personal experiences with self-tracking and attitudes toward sharing self-tracked data with others. We draw on findings from these studies to character-ize students' motivations, challenges, and preferences in col-lecting and viewing self-tracked data related to mental wellness, and we compare findings between students with di-agnosed mental illnesses and those without. We conclude with a discussion of challenges and opportunities in leverag-ing self-tracking for mental wellness, highlighting several design considerations.},

abstract = {Background: Patient-generated health data (PGHD) are health-related data created or recorded by patients to inform their self-care and understanding about their own health. PGHD is different from other patient-reported outcome data because the collection of data is patient-driven, not practice- or research-driven. Technical applications for assisting patients to collect PGHD supports self-management activities such as healthy eating and exercise and can be important for preventing and managing disease. Technological innovations (eg, activity trackers) are making it more common for people to collect PGHD, but little is known about how PGHD might be used in outpatient clinics. Objective: The objective of our study was to examine the experiences of health care professionals who use PGHD in outpatient clinics. Methods: We conducted an evaluation of Project HealthDesign Round 2 to synthesize findings from 5 studies funded to test tools designed to help patients collect PGHD and share these data with members of their health care team. We conducted semistructured interviews with 13 Project HealthDesign study team members and 12 health care professionals that participated in these studies. We used an immersion-crystallization approach to analyze data. Our findings provide important information related to health care professionals' attitudes toward and experiences with using PGHD in a clinical setting. Results: Health care professionals identified 3 main benefits of PGHD accessibility in clinical settings: (1) deeper insight into a patient's condition; (2) more accurate patient information, particularly when of clinical relevance; and (3) insight into a patient's health between clinic visits, enabling revision of care plans for improved health goal achievement, while avoiding unnecessary clinic visits. Study participants also identified 3 areas of consideration when implementing collection and use of PGHD data in clinics: (1) developing practice workflows and protocols related to PGHD collection and use; (2) data storage, accessibility at the point of care, and privacy concerns; and (3) ease of using PGHD data. Conclusions: PGHD provides value to both patients and health care professionals. However, more research is needed to understand the benefit of using PGHD in clinical care and to identify the strategies and clinic workflow needs for optimizing these tools.

abstract = {Phenology is a key aspect of plant success. Recent research has demonstrated that herbarium specimens can provide important information on plant phenology. Massive digitization efforts have the potential to greatly expand herbarium-based phenological research, but also pose a serious challenge regarding efficient data collection. Here, we introduce CrowdCurio, a crowdsourcing tool for the collection of phenological data from herbarium specimens. We test its utility by having workers collect phenological data (number of flower buds, open flowers and fruits) from specimens of two common New England (USA) species: Chelidonium majus and Vaccinium angustifolium. We assess the reliability of using nonexpert workers (i.e. Amazon Mechanical Turk) against expert workers. We also use these data to estimate the phenological sensitivity to temperature for both species across multiple phenophases. We found no difference in the data quality of nonexperts and experts. Nonexperts, however, were a more efficient way of collecting more data at lower cost. We also found that phenological sensitivity varied across both species and phenophases. Our study demonstrates the utility of CrowdCurio as a crowdsourcing tool for the collection of phenological data from herbarium specimens. Furthermore, our results highlight the insight gained from collecting large amounts of phenological data to estimate multiple phenophases.},

We recommend CE in patients with known CD and unexplained symptoms only when abnormalities detected with CE will alter management. 8. We suggest enteroscopy in patients with IBD who have abnormalities within reach of the enteroscope seen on other imaging studies to facilitate endoscopic and histologic evaluation and the potential for therapeutic interventions. 9. We suggest EUS for characterizing and managing fistulous perianal CD in conjunction with other imaging modalities. 10. We recommend the Montreal Classification System 26 be used to standardize reporting of disease extent and IBD phenotypes for both UC and CD. 11. We recommend endoscopic and histologic assessment of the pouch and afferent limb in symptomatic patients. 12. We suggest endoscopic evaluation of the neoterminal ileum 6 to 12 months after surgery in order to riskstratify patients whose medical management may be affected by endoscopic recurrence. 13. We recommend that all patients with UC or CD colitis undergo a screening colonoscopy 8 years after disease onset to (1) re-evaluate extent of disease and (2) initiate surveillance for colorectal neoplasia. 14. We recommend surveillance colonoscopy be performed every 1 to 3 years beginning after 8 years of disease in patients with UC with macroscopic or histologic evidence of inflammation proximal to and including the sigmoid colon and for patients with Crohn's colitis with greater than one-third of colon involvement. 15. We recommend chromoendoscopy with targeted biopsies as the preferred surveillance technique to maximize dysplasia detection. 16. We suggest that chromoendoscopy-targeted biopsies are sufficient for dysplasia surveillance in patients with IBD and that consideration should be given to taking two biopsies from each colon segment for histologic staging to assess extent and severity of inflammation. 17. We suggest that random biopsies with targeted biopsies of any suspicious appearing lesions remain a reasonable alternative for dysplasia surveillance if the yield of chromoendoscopy is reduced by significant underlying inflammation, significant pseudopolyposis, or poor preparation or if chromoendoscopy is not available. 18. We recommend that patients with IBD whose polypoid dysplastic lesions have been removed completely receive endoscopic surveillance at 1 to 6 months and at 12 months, with yearly surveillance thereafter. 19. We suggest that patients with IBD whose non-polypoid dysplastic lesions have been removed completely receive endoscopic surveillance at 1 to 6 months and at 12 months, with yearly surveillance thereafter. 20. We recommend proctocolectomy in patients with IB Dif a detected lesion is not endoscopically resectable,if there is evidence of dysplasia at the base of the lesion, or if endoscopically invisible HGD or multifocal LGD is found in the colon during a high-quality chromoendoscopy examination. 21.

In addition to the significant debates surrounding ideal methods to collect and interpret measures of HRV, standardized reporting of methodology in this field is lacking. Commonly cited recommendations were designed well before recent calls to improve research communication and reproducibility across disciplines. In an effort to standardize reporting, we propose the Guidelines for Reporting Articles on Psychiatry and Heart rate variability (GRAPH), a checklist with four domains: participant selection, interbeat interval collection, data preparation and HRV calculation. This paper provides an overview of these four domains and why their standardized reporting is necessary to suitably evaluate HRV research in psychiatry and related disciplines. Adherence to these communication guidelines will help expedite the translation of HRV research into a potential psychiatric biomarker by improving interpretation, reproducibility and future meta-analyses.},

The assumption that as the number of contributors increases so does the quality is known as ‘Linus' Law' within the Open Source community.

abstract = {Citizen science—the involvement of volunteers in data collection, analysis and interpretation—simultaneously supports research and public engagement with science, and its profile is rapidly rising. Citizen science represents a diverse range of approaches, but until now this diversity has not been quantitatively explored. We conducted a systematic internet search and discovered 509 environmental and ecological citizen science projects. We scored each project for 32 attributes based on publicly obtainable information and used multiple factor analysis to summarise this variation to assess citizen science approaches. We found that projects varied according to their methodological approach from ‘mass participation' (e.g. easy participation by anyone anywhere) to ‘systematic monitoring' (e.g. trained volunteers repeatedly sampling at specific locations). They also varied in complexity from approaches that are ‘simple' to those that are ‘elaborate' (e.g. provide lots of support to gather rich, detailed datasets). There was a separate cluster of entirely computer-based projects but, in general, we found that the range of citizen science projects in ecology and the environment showed continuous variation and cannot be neatly categorised into distinct types of activity. While the diversity of projects begun in each time period (pre 1990, 1990–99, 2000–09 and 2010–13) has not increased, we found that projects tended to have become increasingly different from each other as time progressed (possibly due to changing opportunities, including technological innovation). Most projects were still active so consequently we found that the overall diversity of active projects (available for participation) increased as time progressed. Overall, understanding the landscape of citizen science in ecology and the environment (and its change over time) is valuable because it informs the comparative evaluation of the ‘success' of different citizen science approaches. Comparative evaluation provides an evidence-base to inform the future development of citizen science activities.},

In the health sector, data volumes are growing with genomic, phenotypic, microbiomic, metabolomic, self-tracking, and other data streams. Simultaneously, tools are proliferating to allow individuals and groups to make sense of these data in a participatory manner through personal health tracking devices, mobile health applications, and personal electronic medical records. Health community computing models are emerging to support individual activity and mass collaboration through health social networks and crowdsourced health research studies. Participatory health efforts portend important benefits based on both size and speed. Studies can be carried out in cohorts of thousands instead of hundreds, and it could be possible to apply findings from newly-published studies with near-immediate speed. One operator of interventional crowdsourced health research studies, DIYgenomics, has several crowdsourced health research studies in open enrollment as of January 2012 in the areas of vitamin deficiency, aging, mental performance, and epistemology. The farther future of intelligent health community computing could include personal health dashboards, continuous personal health information climates, personal virtual coaches (e.g.; Siri 2.0), and an efficient health frontier of dynamic personalized health recommendations and action-taking.

abstract = {A significant shift is underway as the fields of health and biology are re-organizing into the larger ecosystems of information sciences and complexity sciences. The era of big data is transforming all economic sectors including health and biology. Three big health data streams are being integrated into a standardized investigative method in the realization of personalized medicine - creating individualized risk profiles and interventions such that medical conditions may be combatted during the 80{\%} of their life-cycle while they are still pre-clinical. These three big health data streams are traditional medical data, 'omics' data (genomics, microbiomics, proteomics, etc.), and biometrie quantified-self daily analytic data. Sequencing costs have continued to decrease such that consumer 'omics' data is increasingly available. Simultaneously, the potentially fast-arriving wearable electronics platform (smartwatches, disposable patches, augmented eyewear, etc.) means that it could become possible to unobtrusively collect vast amounts of previously-unavailable objective metric data for each individual and parlay this into personalized physical and mental health optimization platforms. Two experimental protocols are presented here putting this model of integrated health data streams into action and extending recent social intelligence genomics research into the realm of cognitive performance genomics. The DIYgenomics Quantified Creativity study investigates potential linkage between personal genomics and the creative process of the individual. The DIYgenomics Thinking Fast and Slow study examines cognitive bias in thinking (loss aversion and optimism bias) versus personal genomic profiles. The studies integrate big health data streams including traditional health data, personal genomics, quantified self-reported data, standardized questionnaires, and personalized intervention.

abstract = {Personal informatics applications in a variety of domains are increasingly enabled by low-cost personal sensing. Although applications capture fine-grained activity for self-reflection, sharing is generally limited to high-level summaries. There are potential advantages to fine-grained sharing, but also potential harms. To help investigate this complex design space, we employ Value Sensitive Design to consider whether and how to share fine-grained step activity. We identify key values and value tensions, and we develop scenarios to highlight these. We then design a set of data transformations that seek to maximize the benefits while minimizing the harms of detailed sharing. These include a novel approach to interactive modification of fine-grained step data, allowing people to remove private data and using motif discovery to generate realistic replacement data. Finally, we conduct semi-structured interviews with 12 participants examining these scenarios and transformations. We distill results into a set of design considerations for fine- grained physical activity sharing.},

Prior work has identified several barriers to use as well as discrepancies between designer goals and how these features are used in practice. We develop a framework for designing and evaluating these features based on an extensive review of prior literature. We demonstrate the value of this framework by analyzing physical activity sharing on Twitter, coding 4,771 tweets and their responses and gathering 444 reactions from 97 potential tweet recipients, learning that specific user-generated content leads to more responses and is better received by the post audience.

We explore how designs can support people when they lapse in tracking, considering how to design data representations for a person who lapses in Fitbit use. Through a survey of 141 people who had lapsed in using Fitbit, we identified three use patterns and four perspectives on tracking. Participants then viewed seven visual representations of their Fitbit data and seven approaches to framing this data. Participant Fitbit use and perspective on tracking influenced their preference, which we surface in a series of contrasts. Specifically, our findings guide selecting appropriate aggregations from Fitbit use (e.g., aggregate more when someone has less data), choosing an appropriate framing technique from tracking perspective (e.g., ensure framing aligns with how the person feels about tracking), and creating appropriate social comparisons (e.g., portray the person positively compared to peers). We conclude by discussing how these contrasts suggest new designs and opportunities in other tracking domains.},

We examine how lived informatics manifests in the habits of self-trackers across a variety of domains, first by surveying 105, 99, and 83 past and present trackers of physical activity, finances, and location and then by interviewing 22 trackers regarding their lived informatics experiences. We develop a model characterizing tracker processes of deciding to track and selecting a tool, elaborate on tool usage during collection, integration, and reflection as components of tracking and acting, and discuss the lapsing and potential resuming of tracking.

We examine crumbs through developing and deploying the iPhone application Food4Thought. In a 3-week field study with 61 participants, crumbs supported engagement and mindfulness while offering opportunities to learn about food. Our 2x2 study compared nutrition versus non-nutrition crumbs coupled with social versus non-social features. Nutrition crumbs often felt more purposeful to participants, but non-nutrition crumbs increased mindfulness more than nutrition crumbs. Social features helped sustain engagement and were important for engagement with non-nutrition crumbs. Social features also enabled learning about the variety of foods other people use to meet a challenge.},

To understand menstrual cycle tracking practices, we collected and analyzed data from three sources: 2,000 reviews of popular menstrual tracking apps, a survey of 687 people, and follow-up interviews with 12 survey respondents. We find that women track their menstrual cycle for varied reasons that include remembering and predicting their period as well as informing conversations with healthcare providers. Participants described six methods of tracking their menstrual cycles, including use of technology, awareness of their premenstrual physiological states, and simply remembering. Although women find apps and calendars helpful, these methods are ineffective when predictions of future menstrual cycles are inaccurate. Designs can create feelings of exclusion for gender and sexual minorities. Existing apps also generally fail to consider life stages that women experience, including young adulthood, pregnancy, and menopause. Our findings encourage expanding the field's conceptions of personal informatics.},

Although emerging technologies bolster opportunities to extract PGHD and profile the needs and experiences of patients, few efforts examine the validity and use of such profiles from the patient's perspective. To address this gap, we explore health interest profiles built automatically from online community posts. Through a user evaluation with community members, we found that extracted profiles not only align with members' stated health interests, but also expand upon those manually entered interests with little user effort. Community members express positive attitudes toward the use and expansion of profiles to connect with peers for support. Despite this promising approach, findings also point to improvements required of biomedical text processing tools to effectively process PGHD. Findings demonstrate opportunities to leverage the wealth of unstructured PGHD available in emerging technologies that patients regularly use.},

abstract = {Objective Online health communities offer a diverse peer support base, yet users can struggle to identify suitable peer mentors as these communi-ties grow. To facilitate mentoring connections, we designed a peer-matching system that automatically profiles and recommends peer mentors to mentees based on person-generated health data (PGHD). This study examined the profile characteristics that mentees value when choosing a peer mentor. Materials and Methods Through a mixed-methods user study, in which cancer patients and caregivers evaluated peer mentor recommendations, we examined the relative importance of four possible profile elements: health interests, language style, demographics, and sample posts. Playing the role of mentees, the study participants ranked mentors, then rated both the likelihood that they would hypothetically contact each mentor and the helpfulness of each profile element in helping the make that decision. We analyzed the participants' ratings with linear regression and qualita-tively analyzed participants' feedback for emerging themes about choosing mentors and improving profile design. Results Of the four profile elements, only sample posts were a significant predictor for the likelihood of a mentee contacting a mentor. Communication cues embedded in posts were critical for helping the participants choose a compatible mentor. Qualitative themes offer insight into the interpersonal characteristics that mentees sought in peer mentors, including being knowledgeable, sociable, and articulate. Additionally, the participants emphasized the need for streamlined profiles that minimize the time required to choose a mentor. Conclusion Peer-matching systems in online health communities offer a promising approach for leveraging PGHD to connect patients. Our findings point to interpersonal communication cues embedded in PGHD that could prove critical for building mentoring relationships among the growing membership of online health communities.},

abstract = {The means by which vaginal microbiomes help prevent urogenital diseases in women and maintain health are poorly understood. To gain insight into this, the vaginal bacterial communities of 396 asymptomatic North American women who represented four eth- nic groups (white, black, Hispanic, and Asian) were sampled and the species composition characterized by pyrosequencing of barcoded 16S rRNA genes. The communities clustered into five groups: four were dominated by Lactobacillus iners, L crispatus, L gasseri, or L jensenii, whereas the fifth had lower proportions of lactic acid bacteria and higher proportions of strictly anaerobic organisms, indicating that a potential key ecological function, the production of lactic acid, seems to be conserved in all communities. The pro- portions of each community group varied among the four ethnic groups, and these differences were statistically significant [$\chi$2(10) = 36.8, Ρ {\textless} 0.0001]. Moreover, the vaginal pH of women in different ethnic groups also differed and was higher in Hispanic (pH 5.0 ± 0.59) and black (pH 4.7 ± 1.04) women as compared with Asian (pH 4.4 ± 0.59) and white (pH 4.2 ± 0.3) women. Phylotypes with cor- related relative abundances were found in all communities, and these patterns were associated with either high or low Nugent scores, which are used as a factor for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. The inherent differences within and between women in different ethnic groups strongly argues for a more refined definition of the kinds of bacterial communities normally found in healthy women and the need to appreciate differences be- tween individuals so they can be taken into account in risk as- sessment and disease diagnosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Gene-environment studies demonstrate variability in nutrient requirements depending upon individual variations in genes affecting nutrient metabolism and transport. This study investigated whether the inclusion of genetic information to personalize a patient's diet (nutrigenetics) could improve long term weight management. METHODS Patients with a history of failures at weight loss were offered a nutrigenetic test screening 24 variants in 19 genes involved in metabolism. 50 patients were in the nutrigenetic group and 43 patients attending the same clinic were selected for comparison using algorithms to match the characteristics: age, sex, frequency of clinical visits and BMI at initial clinic visit. The second group of 43 patients did not receive a nutrigenetic test. BMI reduction at 100 and {\textgreater} 300 days and blood fasting glucose were measured. RESULTS After 300 days of follow-up individuals in the nutrigenetic group were more likely to have maintained some weight loss (73{\%}) than those in the comparison group (32{\%}), resulting in an age and gender adjusted OR of 5.74 (95{\%} CI 1.74-22.52). Average BMI reduction in the nutrigenetic group was 1.93 kg/m2(5.6{\%} loss) vs. an average BMI gain of 0.51 kg/m2(2.2{\%} gain) (p {\textless} 0.023). Among patients with a starting blood fasting glucose of {\textgreater} 100 mg/dL, 57{\%} (17/30) of the nutrigenetic group but only 25{\%} (4/16) of the non-tested group had levels reduced to {\textless} 100 mg/dL after {\textgreater} 90 days of weight management therapy (OR for lowering glucose to {\textless} 100 mg/dL due to diet = 1.98 95{\%}CI 1.01, 3.87, p {\textless} 0.046). CONCLUSION Addition of nutrigenetically tailored diets resulted in better compliance, longer-term BMI reduction and improvements in blood glucose levels.},

In health care, however, stakeholders have myriad, often conflicting goals, including access to services, profitability, high quality, cost containment, safety, convenience, patient-centeredness, and satisfaction. Lack of clarity about goals has led to divergent approaches, gaming of the system, and slow progress in performance improvement.

Private companies are attempting to capitalize on these advances by providing direct-to-consumer (DTC)6 genetic testing that estimates the risk of disease for a customer, given their genotype. Because these tests make claims about medical conditions, they have come under scrutiny by regulatory agencies.

abstract = {Healthcare institutions face widespread challenges of delivering high-quality and cost-effective care, while keeping up with rapid advances in biomedical knowledge and technologies. Moreover, there is increased emphasis on developing personalized or precision medicine targeted to individuals or groups of patients who share a certain biomarker signature. Learning healthcare systems (LHS) have been proposed for integration of research and clinical practice to fill major knowledge gaps, improve care, reduce healthcare costs, and provide precision care. To date, much discussion in this context has focused on the potential of human genomic data, and not yet on human microbiome data. Rapid advances in human microbiome research suggest that profiling of, and interventions on, the human microbiome can provide substantial opportunity for improved diagnosis, therapeutics, risk management, and risk stratification. In this study, we discuss a potential role for microbiome science in LHSs. We first review the key elements of LHSs, and discuss possibilities of Big Data and patient engagement. We then consider potentials and challenges of integrating human microbiome research into clinical practice as part of an LHS. With rapid growth in human microbiome research, patient-specific microbial data will begin to contribute in important ways to precision medicine. Hence, we discuss how patient-specific microbial data can help guide therapeutic decisions and identify novel effective approaches for precision care of inflammatory bowel disease. To the best of our knowledge, this expert analysis makes an original contribution with new insights poised at the emerging intersection of LHSs, microbiome science, and postgenomics medicine.},

Clinical, genetic, and experimental data support the role of gut microbiota in contributing to the etiopathogenesis of these diseases. In IBD, the development of gut dysbiosis and imbalances in host-microbe relationships contribute to the extent, severity, and chronicity of intestinal inflammation. With continued advances in knowledge, technology, bioinformatics tools, and capabilities to define disease subsets, we will be able to lower risk and improve clinical outcomes in IBD through individualized interventions that restore host-microbial balance.

Providers and patients must all too often rely upon their own individual-level experience to inform clinical practice, which generates only anecdotal and unstructured data. While academic-led clinical trials are occasionally conducted to test off-label uses of drugs with expired patents, this is relatively rare. In this work, we explored how a patient-centered online research platform could supplement traditional trials to create a richer understanding of medical products postmarket by efficiently aggregating structured patient-reported data. PatientsLikeMe is a tool for patients, researchers, and caregivers (currently 82,000 members across 11 condition-based communities) that helps users make treatment decisions, manage symptoms, and improve outcomes. Members enter demographic information, longitudinal treatment, symptoms, outcome data, and treatment evaluations. These are reflected back as longitudinal health profiles and aggregated reports. Over the last 3 years, patients have entered treatment histories and evaluations on thousands of medical products. These data may aid in evaluating the effectiveness and safety of some treatments more efficiently and over a longer period of time course than is feasible through traditional trials.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This project investigates the ways in which patients respond to the shared use of what is often considered private information: personal health data. There is a growing demand for patient access to personal health records. The predominant model for this record is a repository of all clinically relevant health information kept securely and viewed privately by patients and their health care providers. While this type of record does seem to have beneficial effects for the patient-physician relationship, the complexity and novelty of these data coupled with the lack of research in this area means the utility of personal health information for the primary stakeholders-the patients-is not well documented or understood. OBJECTIVE: PatientsLikeMe is an online community built to support information exchange between patients. The site provides customized disease-specific outcome and visualization tools to help patients understand and share information about their condition. We begin this paper by describing the components and design of the online community. We then identify and analyze how users of this platform reference personal health information within patient-to-patient dialogues. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) post data on their current treatments, symptoms, and outcomes. These data are displayed graphically within personal health profiles and are reflected in composite community-level symptom and treatment reports. Users review and discuss these data within the Forum, private messaging, and comments posted on each other's profiles. We analyzed member communications that referenced individual-level personal health data to determine how patient peers use personal health information within patient-to-patient exchanges. RESULTS: Qualitative analysis of a sample of 123 comments (about 2{\%} of the total) posted within the community revealed a variety of commenting and questioning behaviors by patient members. Members referenced data to locate others with particular experiences to answer specific health-related questions, to proffer personally acquired disease-management knowledge to those most likely to benefit from it, and to foster and solidify relationships based on shared concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies examine the use of personal health information by patients themselves. This project suggests how patients who choose to explicitly share health data within a community may benefit from the process, helping them engage in dialogues that may inform disease self-management. We recommend that future designs make each patient's health information as clear as possible, automate matching of people with similar conditions and using similar treatments, and integrate data into online platforms for health conversations.},

The purpose of this paper is to define products and a preliminary process for efficiently and adaptively creating and curating a knowledge base for behavior change for real-world implementation. We look to evidence-based practice suggestions and draw parallels to software development. We argue to target three products: (1) the smallest, meaningful, selfcontained, and repurposable behavior change modules of an intervention; (2) Bcomputational models{\^{}} that define the interaction between modules, individuals, and context; and (3) Bpersonalization{\^{}} algorithms, which are decision rules for intervention adaptation. The Bagile science{\^{}} process includes a generation phase whereby contender operational definitions and constructs of the three products are created and assessed for feasibility and an evaluation phase, whereby effect size estimates/ casual inferences are created. The process emphasizes early-and-often sharing. If correct, agile science could enable a more robust knowledge base for behavior change.},

To show the utility of this frame- work, we present an implementation in the domain of frac- tions and numberlines, using an online educational game as the source of players. Our system is able to automatically explore the parameter space and generate hypotheses about what types of numberlines lead to maximal short-term trans- fer; testing on a separate dataset shows the most promising hypotheses are valid. We briefly discuss our results in the context of the wider educational literature, showing that one of our results is not explained by current research on multiple fraction representations, thus proving our ability to generate potentially interesting hypotheses to test.},

Our algorithm, UCB-Explore, allows the experimenter to explicitly spec-ify the tradeoff these two objectives. We assess the per-formance of our algorithm in a simulated experiment with parameters drawn from a real-world data. In this simula-tion, our algorithm is better able to navigate this trade off compared to other multi-armed bandit algorithms such as UCB1 and As an example application, we show how a researcher could use the generated samples to iden-tify strong and weak interaction effects, and confirm these findings on a separately-collected dataset.},

In that series, 100 {\%} of 13 patients with duodenal ulcer were found to be infected. The hypothesis that peptic ulcer was caused by a bacterial infection was not accepted without a fight. Most experts believed that Helicobacter was a harmless commensal, infecting people who had ulcers for some other reason. In response, Marshall drank a culture of Helicobacter to prove that the bacteria could infect a healthy person and cause gastritis. The truth behind peptic ulcers was revealed; that is, very young children acquired the Helicobacter organism, leading to a chronic infection which caused a lifelong susceptibility to peptic ulcers. Marshall developed new treatments for the infection and diagnostic tests which allowed the hypothesis to be evaluated and proven. After 1994 Helicobacter was generally accepted as the cause of most gastroduodenal diseases including peptic ulcer and gastric cancer. As a result of this knowledge, treatment is a simple procedure, and stomach surgery has become a rarity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paper food and gastrointestinal (GI) symptom journals are used to help irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients determine potential trigger foods. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, usability, and clinical utility of such journals as a data collection tool. A secondary aim was to explore a method for analyzing journal data to describe patterns of diet and symptoms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Participants (N=17) were asked to log three sets of 3-day food and symptom journals over a 15-day period. Feasibility was evaluated by journal completion rates, symptom logging compliance, and logging fatigability. The feasibility, usability, and clinical utility of journaling were also assessed by a customized evaluation and exit interview. For each journal, regression analyses were conducted to examine relationships between key meal nutrients and subsequent symptoms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: Most participants were young (mean age 35±12) Caucasian (N=13) women (N=14). Journal completion rates were 100{\%} for all participants with no logging fatigability. Over half perceived paper journaling of food and symptoms as feasible, usable, and clinically useful. Thirteen participants demonstrated a strong association with at least one symptom and meal nutrient. Patterns of associations differed among participants.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: Paper journaling of food and GI symptoms for 9 days over a 15-day period appeared to be a feasible and usable data collection tool for IBS patients. Over half perceived journaling as at least somewhat clinically useful. Findings from this study support the anecdote that food trigger(s) and associated symptom(s) vary for each individual.},

In this paper, we reflect on self-experimentation practices in the context of amateur citizen science communities. We report findings from 11 month-long qualitative fieldwork in a community of nutrition hobbyists experimenting with a powdered food substitute "soylent". Our respondents customized the soylent powders to their personal needs, tracked their metabolic reactions to the diet, and discussed their findings with the online soylent user community. Although the data and knowledge sharing within the community positively impacted respondents' nutrition literacy, these activities created risks regarding their health safety and data privacy. We define soylent self-experimentation as a form of "extreme citizen science". Based on the limitations identified in the soylent community, we suggest a set of design recommendations for extreme citizen science projects.},

@article{Wicks2011,
abstract = {Patients with serious diseases may experiment with drugs that have not received regulatory approval. Online patient communities structured around quantitative outcome data have the potential to provide an observational environment to monitor such drug usage and its consequences. Here we describe an analysis of data reported on the website PatientsLikeMe by patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who experimented with lithium carbonate treatment. To reduce potential bias owing to lack of randomization, we developed an algorithm to match 149 treated patients to multiple controls (447 total) based on the progression of their disease course. At 12 months after treatment, we found no effect of lithium on disease progression. Although observational studies using unblinded data are not a substitute for double-blind randomized control trials, this study reached the same conclusion as subsequent randomized trials, suggesting that data reported by patients over the internet may be useful for accelerating clinical discovery and evaluating the effectiveness of drugs already in use. Online communities such as PatientsLikeMe that provide robust methods for patients to record and share data may have the potential to be used to conduct observational studies to assess the effectiveness of treatments. Although observational studies inherently cannot meet the gold standard of randomized clinical trials, they provide an oppor-tunity to collect possibly useful early-phase data by capturing patients' self-experimentation. Empowering observational studies of patients' self-experimentation carries some risks. Nevertheless, an increasing level of self-experimentation is already happening 1 . In this context, it is possible that patient-reported outcome data collected over the Internet could be integrated into academic and/or industry-led cycles of product development and evaluation 2 . Approximately half of ALS patients take vitamins and unproven supplements 3 , whereas a smaller number go to extraordinary lengths to experiment with unproven treatments such as stem cell transplants in the developing world 4 . Recently, a consortium of 75 ALS physi-cians, scientists and experts (ALSUntangled.com) has been formed to investigate the use of self-experimentation, complementary and alternative medicine, and off-label drug usage 5 . There are a number of benefits to systematically studying patients' self-experimentation. First, it is important to respect patients' autonomy and their deci-sions; helping them participate in systematic evaluations may increase scientific literacy. Second, there is an obligation to collect data on the safety of self-experimentation. Unproven treatments might have substantial safety concerns, and risks to patients may be increased without a way to report safety issues. Finally, there is the chance that something (i.e., off-label usage, a change in dosage, delivery route or combination with other treatments) might actually be shown to be efficacious, leading to further study. ALS is a condition where both randomized trials and nonrand-omized clinical studies have yet to provide an effective therapy. It is a cruel and rapidly fatal neurodegenerative disease causing progres-sive weakness and muscle atrophy; median survival from symptom onset is 2–5 years 6 . In 2008, a study described the potential efficacy of lithium carbonate to slow the progression of ALS in a small, single-blind trial of 16 treated patients and 28 controls 7 . Despite skepticism from the medical community 8–10 , some ALS patients were enthusi-astic about the treatment 11 and by their own initiative used an online spreadsheet to gather data. PatientsLikeMe built a lithium-specific data collection tool (see Supplementary Fig. 1) to capture informa-tion about the 348 ALS patients registered with the PatientsLikeMe website who began taking the drug off-label via their physician. To investigate whether the major effect of lithium carbonate reported in the original study was corroborated in these 348 patients, we under-took an observational analysis of self-reported outcomes. ALS disease progression is evaluated using the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R 12 , henceforth referred to as FRS), which measures patient-reported functional impairment in domains such as speech, swallowing, walking, arm function and respiratory function. This metric is one of the standard outcome measures used in ALS clinical trials. In the absence of randomization, blinding or a placebo group, a technique was needed to overcome potential biases, such as the inherent self-selection of self-experimentation in an online sample, the placebo effect and attrition.},

Five medical and surgical treatments, once considered to be efficacious by their proponents but no longer considered effective based upon later controlled trials, were selected according to strict inclusion criteria. A search of the English literature was conducted for all studies published for each treatment area. The results of these studies were categorized, where possible, into excellent, good, and poor outcomes. For these five treatments combined, 40 {\%} excellent, 30 {\%} good, and 30 {\%} poor results were reported by proponents. We conclude that, under conditions of heightened expectations, the power of nonspecific effects far exceeds that commonly reported in the literature.

The authors examine the framework's applicability to various health conditions and present an initial case study with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND MATERIALS: An in-depth literature review was performed to develop the framework and to identify absolute and desired health condition requirements for the application of this framework. The authors developed mobile application prototypes, storyboards, and process flows of the framework using IBS as the case study. The authors conducted three focus groups and an online survey using a human-centered design approach for assessing the framework's feasibility.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: All 6 focus group participants had a positive view about our framework and volunteered to participate in future studies. Most stated they would trust the results because it was their own data being analyzed. They were most concerned about confounds, nonmeaningful measures, and erroneous assumptions on the timing of trigger effects. Survey respondents (N = 60) were more likely to be adherent to an 8- vs 12-day study length even if it meant lower confidence results.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: Implementation of the self-experimentation framework in a mobile application appears to be feasible for people with IBS. This framework can likely be applied to other health conditions. Considerations include the learning curve for teaching self-experimentation to non-experts and the challenges involved in operationalizing and customizing study designs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Using mobile technology to guide people through self-experimentation to investigate health questions is a feasible and promising approach to advancing personalized health.},

abstract = {Touchstone is an open-source experiment design platform designed to help establish a solid research foundation for HCI in the area of novel interaction techniques. Touchstone includes a design platform for exploring alternative designs of controlled laboratory experiments, a run platform for running subjects and a limited analysis platform for advice and access to on-line statistics packages. Designed for HCI researchers and their students, Touchstone facilitates the process of creating new experiments, as well as replicating and extending experiments in the research literature. We tested Touchstone by designing two controlled experiments. One illustrates how to create a new experiment from scratch. The other replicates and extends a previous study of multiscale pointing interaction techniques: OrthoZoom was fastest, followed by bi-manual Pan {\&} Zoom; SDAZ and traditional Pan {\&} Zoom were consistently slower.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method and results of an ethnographic study aimed at building an understanding of Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) adoption in Mumbai, India. The study combined field observations and semi-structured interviews (N = 43) of early ATM adopters, bank customers who do not use ATMs, and people who used the ATM for the first time as part of our research. Data were analysed to identify specific cultural traits that may affect the adoption of ATMs in urban India. Results demonstrated the unique role of the cultural context in affecting users' expectations and behavioural possibilities, thus determining people's response to the machine. This led to the conclusion that an understanding of cultural biases and metaphors can facilitate technology diffusion and acceptance informing design localisation and supporting the development of strategies to motivate and train users. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Modern theories of cognitive and constructive learning portray students as agents who set and pursue goals. More effective students select among cognitive tactics they use to approach goals and learn from false starts and setbacks. These students self-regulate not merely performance but also how they learn. How do students develop forms for self-regulating learning? The author suggests they experiment thereby bootstrapping newer forms of self-regulated learning from prior forms. Experimenting is an arduous way to build knowledge and it is subject to at least 3 obstacles that may be especially troublesome for young students: obtaining sufficient practice with appropriate feedback, remembering how learning was enacted, and reasoning about factors that affect learning. The author examines these issues and suggests needs for future research that investigates how students develop forms of complex goal-directed cognition that guide learning.},

@misc{Bagozzi1992,
abstract = {Beliefs, attitudes, and intentions are important factors in the adoption of computer technologies. While contemporary representations have focused on explaining the act of using computers, the role of learning to use the computer needs to be better understood within the overall adoption process. Inadequate learning can curtail the adoption and use of a potentially productive system. We introduce a new theoretical model, the theory of trying, in which computer learning is conceptualized as a goal determined by three attitude components: attitude toward success, attitude toward failure, and attitude toward the process of goal pursuit. Intentions to try and actual trying are the theoretical mechanisms linking these goal-directed attitudes to goal attainment. An empirical study is conducted to ascertain the construct validity and utility of the new theory within the context of the adoption of a word processing package. Specifically, we examine convergent validity, internal consistency reliability, stability, discriminant validity, criterion related validity, predictive validity, and nomological validity in a longitudinal field study of 107 users of the program. The new theory is compared to two models: the theory of reasoned action from the field of social psychology and the technology acceptance model, recently introduced in the management literature. Overall, the findings stress the importance of scrutinizing the goals of decision makers and their psychological reactions to these goals in the prediction of the adoption of computers.},

abstract = {Online experiments are widely used to compare specific design alternatives, but they can also be used to produce generalizable knowledge and inform strategic decision making. Doing so often requires sophisticated experimental designs, iterative refinement, and careful logging and analysis. Few tools exist that support these needs. We thus introduce a language for online field experiments called PlanOut. PlanOut separates experimental design from application code, allowing the experimenter to concisely describe experimental designs, whether common “A/B tests” and factorial designs, or more complex designs involving conditional logic or multiple experimental units. These latter designs are often useful for understanding causal mechanisms involved in user behaviors. We demonstrate how experiments from the literature can be implemented in PlanOut, and describe two large field experiments conducted on Facebook with PlanOut. For common scenarios in which experiments are run iteratively and in parallel, we introduce a namespaced management system that encourages sound experimental practice.},

abstract = {People often reject creative ideas, even when espousing creativity as a desired goal. To explain this paradox, we propose that people can hold a bias against creativity that is not necessarily overt and that is activated when people experience a motivation to reduce uncertainty. In two experiments, we manipulated uncertainty using different methods, including an uncertainty-reduction prime. The results of both experiments demonstrated the existence of a negative bias against creativity (relative to practicality) when participants experienced uncertainty. Furthermore, this bias against creativity interfered with participants' ability to recognize a creative idea. These results reveal a concealed barrier that creative actors may face as they attempt to gain acceptance for their novel ideas.},

We work with communities at the extremes of the globalised world – both because of non-literacy and the remote or forbidding environments they inhabit. These groups are the gatekeepers of some key environments on which the future health of the planet depends – from tropical forests to Arctic sea-ice. Here we present the methodologies and tools we are developing to give them a voice.},

abstract = {We carried out metagenomic shotgun sequencing and a metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) of fecal, dental and salivary samples from a cohort of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and healthy controls. Concordance was observed between the gut and oral microbiomes, suggesting overlap in the abundance and function of species at different body sites. Dysbiosis was detected in the gut and oral microbiomes of RA patients, but it was partially resolved after RA treatment. Alterations in the gut, dental or saliva microbiome distinguished individuals with RA from healthy controls, were correlated with clinical measures and could be used to stratify individuals on the basis of their response to therapy. In particular, Haemophilus spp. were depleted in individuals with RA at all three sites and negatively correlated with levels of serum autoantibodies, whereas Lactobacillus salivarius was over-represented in individuals with RA at all three sites and was present in increased amounts in cases of very active RA. Functionally, the redox environment, transport and metabolism of iron, sulfur, zinc and arginine were altered in the microbiota of individuals with RA. Molecular mimicry of human antigens related to RA was also detectable. Our results establish specific alterations in the gut and oral microbiomes in individuals with RA and suggest potential ways of using microbiome composition for prognosis and diagnosis.},

@article{Doshi-Velez2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to measure the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) among patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), which has not been well described previously. METHODS: The rates of IBD among patients with and without ASD were measured in 4 study populations with distinct modes of ascertainment: a health care benefits company, 2 pediatric tertiary care centers, and a national ASD repository. The rates of IBD (established through International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] codes) were compared with respective controls and combined using a Stouffer meta-analysis. Clinical charts were also reviewed for IBD among patients with ICD-9-CM codes for both IBD and ASD at one of the pediatric tertiary care centers. This expert-verified rate was compared with the rate in the repository study population (where IBD diagnoses were established by expert review) and in nationally reported rates for pediatric IBD. RESULTS: In all of case-control study populations, the rates of IBD-related ICD-9-CM codes for patients with ASD were significantly higher than that of their respective controls (Stouffer meta-analysis, P {\textless} 0.001). Expert-verified rates of IBD among patients with ASD were 7 of 2728 patients in one study population and 16 of 7201 in a second study population. The age-adjusted prevalence of IBD among patients with ASD was higher than their respective controls and nationally reported rates of pediatric IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Across each population with different kinds of ascertainment, there was a consistent and statistically significant increased prevalance of IBD in patients with ASD than their respective controls and nationally reported rates for pediatric IBD.},

This article argues that neither of these approaches adequately addresses the problem of those minority groups who have not traditionally done well in the public school. Core curriculum advocates falsely assume that as a result of instituting a core curriculum, demanding higher standards, and patching up supposed individual deficiencies, all students will perform as expected. Multicultural education advocates inadequately design their program to focus on cultural differences in content and form. This article contends that the crucial issue in cultural diversity and learning is the relationship between the minority cultures and the American mainstream culture. Minorities whose cultural frames of reference are oppositional to the cultural frame of reference of American mainstream culture have greater difficulty crossing cultural boundaries at school to learn. Core curriculum and multicultural advocates have yet to understand and take this into account.},

While several studies have suggested that aesthetics in visualization and infographics relate to desirable outcomes like engagement and memorability, it remains unknown how quickly aesthetic impressions are formed, and what it is that makes an infographic appealing. We address these questions by analyzing 1,278 participants' ratings on appeal after seeing infographics for 500ms. Our results establish that: 1) people form a reliable first impression of the appeal of an infographic based on a mere exposure effect, 2) this first impression is largely based on colorfulness and visual complexity, and 3) age, gender, and education level influence the preferred level of colorfulness and complexity. More generally, these findings suggest that outcomes such as engagement and memorability might be determined much earlier than previously thought.},

abstract = {Dementia is estimated to currently affect almost 15{\%} of US adults over the age of 70. As the population ages, the prevalence of dementia will increase proportionally. The increase in the number of people with dementia will create a corresponding increase in health services required. Structured activities are extremely important for this population, leading to greater well-being and positive affect during activities and long term benefits such as delayed progression of cognitive impairments. Despite the importance of activities in dementia care, many people with dementia lack opportunities for sustained social interactions and stimulating activities. There is a clear unmet need for stimulating activities that do not place an additional financial or time burden on staff or families. Technology is a promising venue to engage people with dementia in activities. For example, technology can be used to deliver rich multimedia and standardized interventions, increase access to digital archives, engage people in remote care or contact with loved ones, and monitor and log changes. In my dissertation, I examine the ways technology can support older adults with dementia in engaging in activities in a memory care unit. I discuss existing technologies that support this population in engaging in activities, a six month field deployment of an existing technology, and recommendations for technology design that have been validated with experts in the field of gerontology and human computer interaction. My dissertation furthers our understanding of how to design engaging technologies for older adults with dementia in order to promote meaningful participation in recreational and leisure activities.

However, human evaluation of pathology slides cannot accurately predict patients' prognoses. In this study, we obtain 2,186 haematoxylin and eosin stained histopathology whole-slide images of lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 294 additional images from Stanford Tissue Microarray (TMA) Database. We extract 9,879 quantitative image features and use regularized machine-learning methods to select the top features and to distinguish shorter-term survivors from longer-term survivors with stage I adenocarcinoma (P{\textless}0.003) or squamous cell carcinoma (P=0.023) in the TCGA data set. We validate the survival prediction framework with the TMA cohort (P{\textless}0.036 for both tumour types). Our results suggest that automatically derived image features can predict the prognosis of lung cancer patients and thereby contribute to precision oncology. Our methods are extensible to histopathology images of other organs.},

@article{Xu2016,
abstract = {The rate of data growth outpaces the decline of hardware costs, and there has been an ever-increasing demand in reducing the storage and network overhead for online database management systems (DBMSs). The most widely used approach for data reduction in DBMSs is block- level compression. Although this method is simple and effective, it fails to address redundancy across blocks and therefore leaves significant room for improvement for many applications. This dissertation proposes a systematic approach, termed similarity- based deduplication, which reduces the amount of data stored on disk and transmitted over the network beyond the benefits provided by tra- ditional compression schemes. To demonstrate the approach, we de- signed and implemented dbDedup, a lightweight record-level similarity- based deduplication engine for online DBMSs. The design of dbDedup exploits key observations we find in databaseworkloads, including small item sizes, temporal locality, and the incremental nature of record up- dates. The proposed approach differs from traditional chunk-based deduplication approaches in that, instead of finding identical chunks anywhere else in the data corpus, similarity-based deduplication identi- fies a single similar data-item and performs differential compression to remove the redundant parts for greater savings. To achieve high efficiency, dbDedup introduces novel encoding, caching and similarity selection techniques that significantly mitigate the deduplication overhead with minimal loss of compression ratio. For evaluation, we integrated dbDedup into the storage and replication com- ponents of a distributed NoSQL DBMS and analyzed its properties us- ing four real datasets. Our results show that dbDedup achieves up to 37× reduction in the storage size and replication traffic of the database on its own and up to 61× reduction when paired with the DBMS's block-level compression. dbDedup provides both benefits with negligi- ble effect on DBMS throughput or client latency (average and tail).},

The use of this impoverished medium is challenging for both providers and consumers of feedback. We introduce VidCrit, a system for providing asynchronous feedback on drafts of edited video that incorporates favorable qualities of an in-person review. This system consists of two separate interfaces: (1) A feedback recording interface cap-tures reviewers' spoken comments, mouse interactions, hand gestures and other physical reactions. (2) A feedback view-ing interface transcribes and segments the recorded review into topical comments so that the video author can browse the review by either text or timelines. Our system features novel methods to automatically segment a long review ses-sion into topical text comments, and to label such comments with additional contextual information. We interviewed prac-titioners to inform a set of design guidelines for giving and receiving feedback, and based our system's design on these guidelines. Video reviewers using our system preferred our feedback recording interface over email for providing feed-back due to the reduction in time and effort. In a fixed amount of time, reviewers provided 10.9 (= 5.09) more local com-ments than when using text. All video authors rated our feed-back viewing interface preferable to receiving feedback via},

We present DeduceIt, a system for creating, grading, and analyzing derivation assignments across arbitrary formal domains. DeduceIt supports assignments in any logical formalism, provides students with incremental feedback, and aggregates student paths through each proof to produce instructor analytics. DeduceIt benefits from checking thousands of derivations on the web: it introduces a proof cache, a novel data structure which leverages a crowd of students to decrease the cost of checking derivations and providing real-time, constructive feedback. We evaluate DeduceIt with 990 students in an online compilers course, finding students take advantage of its incremental feedback and instructors benefit from its structured insights into confusing course topics.

With Boomerang, requesters find that their highly- rated workers gain earliest access to their future tasks, and workers find tasks from their highly-rated requesters at the top of their task feed.

abstract = {Figure 1. The SceneSkim interface consists of a search pane for finding clips matching a query and a movie pane for browsing within movies using synchronized documents. The search pane features a keyword search bar (A), search filters (B) and a search results view (C). The movie pane includes the synchronized summary (D), script (E), captions (G), and movie (F). ABSTRACT Searching for scenes in movies is a time-consuming but cru­ cial task for film studies scholars, film professionals, and new media artists. In pilot interviews we have found that such users search for a wide variety of clips—e.g., actions, props, dialogue phrases, character performances, locations— and they return to particular scenes they have seen in the past. Today, these users find relevant clips by watching the entire movie, scrubbing the video timeline, or navigating via DVD chapter menus. Increasingly, users can also index films through transcripts—however, dialogue often lacks vi­ sual context, character names, and high level event descrip­ tions. We introduce SceneSkim, a tool for searching and browsing movies using synchronized captions, scripts and plot summaries. Our interface integrates information from such sources to allow expressive search at several levels of granularity: Captions provide access to accurate dialogue, scripts describe shot-by-shot actions and settings, and plot summaries contain high-level event descriptions. We propose new algorithms for finding word-level caption to script align­ ments, parsing text scripts, and aligning plot summaries to scripts. Film studies graduate students evaluating SceneSkim expressed enthusiasm about the usability of the proposed sys­ tem for their research and teaching.},

Behind the scenes, Chorus leverages multiple crowd workers to propose and vote on responses. A shared memory space helps the dynamic crowd workforce maintain consis- tency, and a game-theoretic incentive mechanism helps to bal- ance their efforts between proposing and voting. Studies with 12 end users and 100 crowd workers demonstrate that Cho- rus can provide accurate, topical responses, answering nearly 93{\%} of user queries appropriately, and staying on-topic in over 95{\%} of responses. We also observed that Chorus has ad- vantages over pairing an end user with a single crowd worker and end users completing their own tasks in terms of speed, quality, and breadth of assistance. Chorus demonstrates a new future in which conversational assistants are made us- able in the real world by combining human and machine in- telligence, and may enable a useful new way of interacting with the crowds powering other systems.},

abstract = {Behavioral researchers spend considerable amount of time coding video data to systematically extract meaning from subtle human actions and emotions. In this paper, we present Glance, a tool that allows researchers to rapidly query, sam- ple, and analyze large video datasets for behavioral events that are hard to detect automatically. Glance takes advantage of the parallelism available in paid online crowds to inter- pret natural language queries and then aggregates responses in a summary view of the video data. Glance provides ana- lysts with rapid responses when initially exploring a dataset, and reliable codings when refining an analysis. Our experi- ments show that Glance can code nearly 50 minutes of video in 5 minutes by recruiting over 60 workers simultaneously, and can get initial feedback to analysts in under 10 seconds for most clips. We present and compare new methods for accurately aggregating the input of multiple workers mark- ing the spans of events in video data, and for measuring the quality of their coding in real-time before a baseline is estab- lished by measuring the variance between workers. Glance's rapid responses to natural language queries, feedback regard- ing question ambiguity and anomalies in the data, and ability to build on prior context in followup queries allow users to have a conversation-like interaction with their data – opening up new possibilities for naturally exploring video data.},

abstract = {We introduce flash teams, a framework for dynamically assembling and managing paid experts from the crowd. Flash teams advance a vision of expert crowd work that accomplishes complex, interdependent goals such as engineering and design. These teams consist of sequences of linked modular tasks and handoffs that can be computationally managed. Interactive systems reason about and manipulate these teams' structures: for example, flash teams can be recombined to form larger organizations and authored automatically in response to a user's request. Flash teams can also hire more people elastically in reaction to task needs, and pipeline intermediate output to accelerate completion times. To enable flash teams, we present Foundry, an end-user authoring platform and runtime manager. Foundry allows users to author modular tasks, then manages teams through handoffs of intermediate work. We demonstrate that Foundry and flash teams enable crowdsourcing of a broad class of goals including design prototyping, course development, and film animation, in half the work time of traditional self-managed teams.},

Most crowdsourcing platforms do not help workers acquire the skills necessary to accomplish complex creative tasks. In this paper, we describe a platform that combines learning and crowdsourcing to benefit both the workers and the requesters. Workers gain new skills through interactive step-by-step tutorials and test their knowledge by improving real-world images submitted by requesters. In a series of three deployments spanning two years, we varied the design of our platform to enhance the learning experience and improve the quality of the crowd work. We tested our approach in the context of LevelUp for Photoshop, which teaches people how to do basic photograph improvement tasks using Adobe Photoshop. We found that by using our system workers gained new skills and produced high-quality edits for requested images, even if they had little prior experience editing images.},

In real-world social dilemmas these choices are temporally extended. Cooperativeness is a property that applies to poli-cies, not elementary actions. We introduce sequential social dilemmas that share the mixed incentive structure of matrix game social dilemmas but also require agents to learn poli-cies that implement their strategic intentions. We analyze the dynamics of policies learned by multiple self-interested independent learning agents, each using its own deep Q-network, on two Markov games we introduce here: 1. a fruit Gathering game and 2. a Wolfpack hunting game. We char-acterize how learned behavior in each domain changes as a function of environmental factors including resource abun-dance. Our experiments show how conflict can emerge from competition over shared resources and shed light on how the sequential nature of real world social dilemmas affects cooperation.},

abstract = {There is an important shift in business focus in the United States that is empowering companies to not only declare their intent to be ethical firms which do good while making a profit, but also to submit proof of that commitment for annual review by outside evaluators. A new business model is providing structure for nonprofits that wish to grow, for for-profits that wish to be socially responsible, and for individuals who wish to invest in companies with a commitment to corporate social responsibility and sustainability. B Lab has taken the lead in providing the models necessary for this shift to a focus on the double bottom line: profit and social benefit. It has created the legal documents for state legislatures to use to pass a new corporate structure called the 'benefit corporation.' In the 3 years of its existence, legislatures in 19 states and the District of Columbia have ratified the new corporate structure. Likewise, B Lab offers a performance assessment program to become a Certified B Corporation, independent of legal corporate status, which also serves as an evaluation program for benefit corporations. Additionally, it has created a ratings agency and analytics platform, the Global Impact Investing Rating System (GIIRS), to help institutional investors evaluate the impact of companies' corporate social responsibility initiatives. This article discusses the requirements and benefits of the new models and addresses the issues that have been raised about them. It also identifies companies that are incorporating the benefit corporation structure and are becoming Certified B Corporations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.},

abstract = {Increasingly, national stakeholders express concern that U.S. college graduates cannot ade- quately solve problems and think critically. As a set of cognitive abilities, critical thinking skills provide students with tangible academic, personal, and professional benefits that may ultimately address these concerns. As an instructional method, writing has long been perceived as a way to improve critical thinking. In the current study, the researchers compared critical thinking performance of students who experienced a laboratory writing treatment with those who experienced traditional quiz-based laboratory in a general education biology course. The effects of writing were determined within the context of multiple covariables. Results indicated that the writing group significantly improved critical thinking skills whereas the nonwriting group did not. Specifically, analysis and inference skills increased significantly in the writing group but not the nonwriting group. Writing students also showed greater gains in evaluation skills; however, these were not significant. In addition to writing, prior critical thinking skill and instructor significantly affected critical thinking performance, whereas other covariables such as gender, ethnicity, and age were not significant. With improved critical thinking skill, general education biology students will be better prepared to solve problems as engaged and productive citizens},

Significant results involving structured questioning techniques (i.e., signal words and generic question stems) were detected primarily through interaction effects and one main effect. While not always significantly superior, generic question stem participants outperformed their signal word and unguided questioning counterparts on the majority of text memory and text learning variables.},

In muscle, alpha-dystroglycan provides a link between the myofibre cytoskeleton through its indirect binding to dystrophin, and the basal lamina through its binding to laminin-2, a protein of the extracellular matrix. The disruption of this linkage between the myofibre cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix is a common feature of Duchenne and other muscular dystrophies, though the pathogenic mechanisms leading to muscle wasting remain unknown. By treating primary mouse muscle cultures with a monoclonal antibody which blocks alpha-dystroglycan binding to laminin, we show here the induction of a dystrophic phenotype in vitro. The phenotype is inducible in differentiated cultures only, is characterised by reduced myotube size, myofibril disorganisation, loss of contractile activity, reduced spontaneous clustering of acetylcholine receptors and is reversed by addition of excess exogenous laminin-2. Thus, alpha-dystroglycan may be part of a signalling pathway for the maturation and maintenance of skeletal myofibres. Detailed knowledge of this signalling pathway may provide insights into the molecular pathology of the various inherited muscular dystrophies, and identify valuable pharmacological targets and new therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6{\%} in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes--although the greatest effects are in small (n [{\&}le;] 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

abstract = {In this article we argue that there is a trade-off between generativity and originality in online communities that support open collaboration. We build on foundational theoretical work in peer production to formulate and test a series of hypotheses suggesting that the generativity of creative works is associated with moderate complexity, prominent authors, and cumulativeness. We also formulate and test three hypotheses that these qualities are associated with decreased originality in resulting derivatives. Our analysis uses a rich data set from the Scratch Online Community—a large website where young people openly share and remix animations and video games. We discuss the implications of this trade-off for the design of peer production systems that support amateur creativity. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},

abstract = {Prior work on creativity support tools demonstrates how a computational semantic model of a solution space can enable interventions that substantially improve the number, quality and diversity of ideas. However, automated semantic model-ing often falls short when people contribute short text snip-pets or sketches. Innovation platforms can employ humans to provide semantic judgments to construct a semantic model, but this relies on external workers completing a large num-ber of tedious micro tasks. This requirement threatens both accuracy (external workers may lack expertise and context to make accurate semantic judgments) and scalability (external workers are costly). In this paper, we introduce IDEAHOUND, an ideation system that seamlessly integrates the task of defin-ing semantic relationships among ideas into the primary task of idea generation. The system combines implicit human actions with machine learning to create a computational se-mantic model of the emerging solution space. The integrated nature of these judgments allows IDEAHOUND to leverage the expertise and efforts of participants who are already moti-vated to contribute to idea generation, overcoming the issues of scalability inherent to existing approaches. Our results show that participants were equally willing to use (and just as productive using) IDEAHOUND compared to a conventional platform that did not require organizing ideas. Our integrated crowdsourcing approach also creates a more accurate seman-tic model than an existing crowdsourced approach (performed by external crowds). We demonstrate how this model enables helpful creative interventions: providing diverse inspirational examples, providing similar ideas for a given idea and pro-viding a visual overview of the solution space.},

abstract = {Experts are often called upon to design interfaces, applications, and instruments for novices. But, there are reasons to believe that expertise may inhibit peoples' ability to understand the novice experience. Data from one study suggests that experts suffer from a cognitive bias that leads them to underestimate the difficulty that novices will encounter when performing an unfamiliar task. The data also suggest that experts' bias toward underestimation is resistant to a commonly used debiasing technique – listing the steps required to perform a task and listing some of the problems that could occur when novices attempt a task for the first time. These results reinforce the importance of including multiple perspectives in the design process and making sure that expert designers work to understand the perspective of their novice users. The results also suggest that simply reading usability reports on the problems experienced by novices may not be adequate to debias experts. It may be necessary to create better ways to facilitate experts' understanding of novices' experience.},

In a 2nd study, the authors found that beginner-instructed novices performed better than expert-instructed novices and reported fewer problems with the instructions when performing the same task. In Study 2, the authors found that although novices performed better on the target task when instructed by beginners, they did better on a different task within the same domain when instructed by experts. The evidence suggests that the abstract, advanced concepts conveyed by experts facilitated the transfer of learning between the different tasks.},

In this paper, we address these questions by comparing and contrasting online, collaborative animated movies, called collabs, with OSS projects.

Finally, we compare and contrast our results with the literature on OSS development and propose broader theoretical implications. Our findings offer a starting point for a systematic research agenda seeking to unlock the potential of online creative collaboration.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the area of the question-its generation, its relation to the retrieval system, and its effect on the inquirer. Four levels of question formation may be isolated and analysed: the actual, but unexpressed, need for information; the conscious within-brain description of the need; the formal statement of the question; and the question as presented to the information system. Input and output characteristics of systems are examined for their effect on the inquirer's decision to ask a question and on the form the query takes. Investigation of six parameters governing question type and ambiguity argues that we may be placing too much emphasis on syntactic matching of inquiry and store of answers. The inquirer's state of readiness is defined as the ldquostate of mindrdquo which allows a selection to be made from a series of messages. A question is seen as an indication of inadequacy on the part of the inquirer who hopes to remedy that inadequacy by calling on the information system. A major objective of information systems is to make commonplace the point of maximum usefulness where three coordinates cross: level of question, state of readiness, and available answer.},

abstract = {The first half-century of American psychology is often represented nowadays as a dark age of rat-running and rote verbal learning experiments, which ended only when it was overwhelmed by the rise of the new cognitive psychology that started in the 1950s (cf. Gardner, 1985). But throughout that early period there was a strain of mainstream experimental psychology that dealt with what we would now call situated learning. It was rat psychology, to be sure, but it was a psychology of situated rat behavior. The central tenet was that animals do not simply learn responses, they learn their environments. Run rats in a maze under typical tightly controlled conditions and they learn a fixed route to the goal. Change things a little and they are lost. But let them run around on their own and they quickly learn the whole maze, so that they can get from wherever you drop them to wherever they want to go by an efficient route. Edward C. Tolman was responsible for the seminal experiments and also for the proposal that ‘place learning,' as he called it, is mainly perceptual and not behavioral (Tolman, 1949). It was Robert S. Woodworth, however, for some time the dean of American experimental psychologists, who made the most forceful effort to shift the mainstream of experimental psychology toward a consideration of organisms interacting with their environments. “If behavior consists in an active dealing with the environment,” he said (Woodworth, 1958, p. 300), “and if it depends very largely on learning, it must depend on what we can properly call ‘learning the environment.' He then went on to elaborate:},

However, this learning approach has some difficulties, one being the lack of a practical approach to assist teachers in evaluating the question-posing ability of all learners. To remedy this problem, the present study developed a system of integrating a reward mechanism into assessment activities, to measure the question-posing ability of individual students in a web-based learning environment. The system has been applied to a learning activity in a programming design course and 100 first-year college students were invited to participate in this research. After the experiment, the results showed the proposed system can serve as both a learning and an assessment tool in higher education, by encouraging students to carry out active learning, constructive criticism and knowledge sharing. A positive satisfaction is derived from the learning activities with the system under two dimensions of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Most importantly, students' learning performance improved significantly},

The paper begins by highlighting the importance and role of students' questions from the perspectives of both the learner and the teacher. It then reviews the empirical research on students' questions, with a focus on four areas: (1) the nature and types of these questions; (2) the effects of teaching students questioning skills; (3) the relationship between students' questions and selected variables; and (4) teachers' responses to, and students' perceptions of, students' questions. Following this, some issues and implications of students' questions for classroom instruction are discussed.

One approach would for experts to provide personalized feed-back, but this scales poorly, and may lead to premature convergence during creative work. Drawing on strategies for facilitating face-to-face brainstorms, we introduce a crowd ideation system where experts monitor incoming ideas through a dashboard and offer high-level "inspira-tions" to guide ideation. A series of controlled experiments show that experienced facilitators increased the quantity and creativity of workers' ideas compared to unfacilitated workers, while Novice facilitators reduced workers' crea-tivity. Analyses of inspiration strategies suggest these opposing results stem from differential use of successful inspiration strategies (e.g., provoking mental simulations). The results show that expert facilitation can significantly improve crowd innovation, but inexperienced facilitators may need scaffolding to be successful.},

abstract = {Designing RNAs that form specific secondary structures is enabling better understanding and control of living systems through RNA-guided silencing, genome editing and protein organization. Little is known, however, about which RNA secondary structures might be tractable for downstream sequence design, increasing the time and expense of design efforts due to inefficient secondary structure choices. Here, we present insights into specific structural features that increase the difficulty of finding sequences that fold into a target RNA secondary structure, summarizing the design efforts of tens of thousands of human participants and three automated algorithms (RNAInverse, INFO-RNA and RNA-SSD) in the Eterna massive open laboratory. Subsequent tests through three independent RNA design algorithms (NUPACK, DSS-Opt and MODENA) confirmed the hypothesized importance of several features in determining design difficulty, including sequence length, mean stem length, symmetry and specific difficult-to-design motifs such as zigzags. Based on these results, we have compiled an Eterna100 benchmark of 100 secondary structure design challenges that span a large range in design difficulty to help test future efforts. Our in silico results suggest new routes for improving computational RNA design methods and for extending these insights to assess "designability" of single RNA structures, as well as of switches for in vitro and in vivo applications.},

abstract = {Computer assisted learning (or E-learning) is used broadly in the developed world. However, comparable technologies are only recently beginning to be used in rural and developing regions. In these environments, obstacles to the successful deployment of edu- cational software include a lack of basic infrastructure, low student attendance, necessary sharing of resources, and the participants'— both teachers and students—unfamiliarity with communications technology. To illustrate these issues in detail, we present a design study for Metamouse, a system for sharing single user software on a single computer with multiple mice. We designed Metamouse during a one and a half month long study in low-income primary schools in Bangalore, India. We iterated through two primary usage paradigms, competitive and collaborative, working with grade four and five students. In these populations, we found that students had widely varying mouse skills, and that even amongst competent users, interface confusion presented significant barriers. Given this, interface tasks that are known to have a cost in usability, such as mode switching or complicated interaction models, had a severe impact on students' ability to use the technology. We discuss interface issues that result from sharing practices that are the norm in these regions. We also discuss issues that generalize across educational application design in the developing world.},

@article{Pawar2006,
abstract = {A distinct feature observed in computer use in schools or rural kiosks in developing countries is the high student-to-computer ratio. It is not unusual to see more than five children crowding around a single display, as schools are rarely funded to afford one PC per child in a classroom. One child controls the mouse, while others are passive onlookers, without operational control of the computer. Learning benefits appear to accrue primarily to the child with the mouse, with the other children missing out. The obvious technical solution is to provide each child with a mouse and cursor on screen, thus effectively multiplying the amount of interaction per student per PC for the cost of a few extra mice. To our surprise, both the concept and the implementation appear to be unique to date, for the specific application to computers in education in resource-strapped communities, with previous work restricting studies to two mice, or for largely non-educational applications. We have developed software that allows multiple coloured cursors to co-exist on the monitor, along with two sample games with some educational content. Initial trials with both single-mouse and multiple-mice scenarios suggest that children are more engaged when in control of a mouse, and that more mice increases overall engagement. Our results suggest new areas of research in pedagogy for computers in education},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 ACM. Though there has been widespread enthusiasm to leverage technology to strengthen low-resource classrooms, to date very few programs have documented rigorous benefits from such interventions. In this paper, we describe an exploratory evaluation of the use of pre-packaged electronic teaching aids, consisting of presentation slides and multimedia content, in a government school in peri-urban India. Via a small-scale randomized controlled trial, encompassing 2 subjects, 72 students, and a 3-week intervention, we measure the impact of the electronic content on learning outcomes. In one subject (English), we find that the intervention significantly increases student scores, measured both by a custom exam as well as a standard unit test in the school. However, in another subject (science), we do not find any evidence for learning benefits. Despite its small scale, this study shows that it is possible to bolster learning in low-resource schools via use of electronic teaching aids, thereby justifying investment in larger scale trials in the future.},

abstract = {As information and communication technology access expands in the developing world, learning technologies have the opportunity to play a growing role to enhance and supplement strained educational systems. Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) offer strong learning gains, but are a class of technology traditionally designed for most-developed countries. Recently, closer consideration has been made to ITS targeting the developing world and to culturally-adapted ITS. This paper presents findings from a systematic literature review that focused on barriers to ITS adoption in the developing world. While ITS were the primary focus of the review, the implications likely apply to a broader range of educational technology as well. The geographical and economic landscape of tutoring publications is mapped out, to determine where tutoring systems research occurs. Next, the paper discusses challenges and promising solutions for barriers to ITS within both formal and informal settings. These barriers include student basic computing skills, hardware sharing, mobile-dominant computing, data costs, electrical reliability, internet infrastructure, language, and culture. Differences and similarities between externally-developed and locally-developed tutoring system research for the developing world are then considered. Finally, this paper concludes with some potential future directions and opportunities for research on tutoring systems and other educational technologies on the global stage. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.},

Of particular importance is literacy in a widely spoken "world language" such as English, which is typically a second language for these speakers. For complex reasons, schools are often not effective as vehicles for second language learning. In this paper we explore game-like language learning on cell phones. We argue that phones are an excellent technology platform in the typical ecologies of developing countries. We present the PACE framework that is intended to support the rapid, scalable development of language learning software localized for a particular community of learners. These learners are usually skeptical of formal education and of cultural biases they encounter in learning "remote" languages in particular. Localization of content is crucial to make the language relevant to them and to encourage them to adopt it.},

Today, wide ranges of e-governance projects are being implemented in different parts of the country including projects aimed at reaching areas and people that had traditionally not been connected to the outside world. This paper uses Sen?s notion of capabilities as an evaluative space for e-governance assessment. Such an emphasis demands a change in the way e-governance is assessed. The capabilities framework allows us to focus on the developmental impact of such projects.

In contrast to prior ICTD multi-input educational designs, MultiLearn+ adapts the educational experience for each student within the group setting. This personalization may better meet individual students' needs.

abstract = {Cellphones have the potential to improve education for the millions of underprivileged users in the developing world. However, mobile learning in developing countries remains under-studied. In this paper, we argue that cellphones are a perfect vehicle for making educational opportunities accessible to rural children in places and times that are more convenient than formal schooling. We carried out participant observations to identify the opportunities in their everyday lives for mobile learning. We next conducted a 26-week study to investigate the extent to which rural children will voluntarily make use of cellphones to access educational content. Our results show a reasonable level of academic learning and motivation. We also report on the social context around these results. Our goal is to examine the feasibility of mobile learning in out-of-school settings in rural, underdeveloped areas, and to help more researchers learn how to undertake similarly difficult studies around mobile computing in the developing world.},

In our work on English language learning among underserved communities in India since 2004, we have observed differences between school communities in terms of their access to educational opportunities outside school, access to ICTs including cellphones and digital gaming, enthusiasm for visitors, and the relationships between students. We report on these observations and argue that they call for the greater use of a comparative approach in constructing models of the micro-cultures at various schools, so that user-centered design processes and methods can better account for the unique differences across communities.},

Of particular importance is fluency in a widely spoken world language such as English, which is typically a second language for these low-income learners. We make the case that mobile games on cellphones is an appropriate solution in the typical ecologies of developing regions. The challenge is to design e-learning games that are both educational and pleasurable for our target learners, who have limited familiarity with high technology. We propose the receptive-practice-activation cycle that could be used as the conceptual model for the designs. We then report how this format could be refined, based on our experiences in the field with three games that have collectively undergone nine rounds of iterations. In particular, it appears that maintaining a distinction between learning and fun to some extent is necessary for effective designs.},

abstract = {Videos are becoming an increasingly popular medium for communicating information, especially for online education. Recent efforts by organizations like Coursera, edX, Udacity and Khan Academy have produced thousands of educational videos with hundreds of millions of views in their attempt to make high quality teaching available to the masses. As a medium, videos are time-consuming to produce and cannot be easily modified after release. As a result, errors or problems with legibility are common. While text-based information platforms like Wikipedia have benefitted enormously from crowdsourced contributions for the creation and improvement of content, the various limitations of video hinder the collaborative editing and improvement of educational videos. To address this issue, we present VidWiki, an online platform that enables students to iteratively improve the presentation quality and content of educational videos. Through the platform, users can improve the legibility of handwriting, correct errors, or translate text in videos by overlaying typeset content such as text, shapes, equations, or images. We conducted a small user study in which 13 novice users annotated and revised Khan Academy videos. Our results suggest that with only a small investment of time on the part of viewers, it may be possible to make meaningful improvements in online educational videos.},

In the blended learning condition, students viewed the video as a group in a classroom, and received the follow-up tutorial from a live lecturer. We randomly assigned 102 students to these conditions, and assessed learning outcomes via a series of quizzes. While we saw significant learning gains after each session conducted, we did not observe any significant differences between the online and blended learning groups.

This article examines the experiences of low-cost computing projects in developing regions and looks at some of the common entrepreneurial and technical problems faced by past and current initiatives. Focusing specifically on the domain of education, we look at the quest for low-cost devices and consider their economic and socio-cultural appropriateness to the typical classroom in the developing world. Using field studies and interviews conducted in rural Indian classrooms, we show that shared rather than single-user devices constitute a more realistic and sustainable approach for low-cost computing projects targeting children's education.

abstract = {Filling the financing gap and delivering quality education will be a major challenge, requiring all hands on deck. State actors—domestic governments and foreign donors—will need to raise their game substantially, but fiscal and capacity constraints are likely to prevent them from closing the gap on their own. Non-state actors—mainly religious and charitable organizations, private (“foundation”) schools, and a small number of for-profit schools—are already filling part of the gap, although the precise extent of their services and their impact is unknown. The appropriate role of non-state actors in education has been contentious among specialists. Disagreements have revolved around normative issues, including such basic questions as “is non-state provision consistent with the principle of education as a human right?” and serious empirical questions relating to quality and equity implications. This discussion has been blurred by definitional issues (what is non-state and private education?), lack of clarity over distinctions between ownership, delivery and financing, and a lack of accurate data on actual provision today and potential for the future. Definitional problems have created difficulties for making comparisons across empirical studies. More generally, there is not a sufficiently strong evidence base from which to draw clear conclusions on the effectiveness of non-state actors in education. This has led to variations in the interpretation of the evidence. For some observers, evidence has fueled concern that non-state education is violating human rights principles (e.g. the report by UN Rapporteur on Education),1 while for others it has provided encouragement that non-state engagement can help address financing and delivery challenges (e.g. Tooley 2009). This paper seeks to provide a background to this debate. The paper begins with some big picture facts, then moves to definitional and evidence issues. It is our hope that it will contribute to the identification of common ground around the role of non-state actors in education and how these actors can best contribute to the achievement of Education for All and Sustainable Development Goals. Our paper refers largely to basic education, including pre-primary, primary, and lower secondary, as this is the main focus of much recent discussion around the role of non-state actors in education and an area of strong growth in developing countries.},

abstract = {The data on population by age and sex is vital for demographers, health administrators etc. for planning and evaluation of various developmental and health programs. The classification of rural/urban, sex and marital status by age unveils the characteristics of population composition and provides disaggregated data for target oriented projects. Being one of the most important demographic characteristics, data on age is collected and updated in both half-yearly surveys of SRS for all the members of the household covered in the sample units. 2.2 As per available data from SRS, there has been a gradual decline in the share of population in the age group 0-14 from 41.2 to 38.1 per cent during 1971 to 1981 and 36.3 to 29.5 percent during 1991 to 2011, whereas, the proportion of economically active population (15-59 years) has increased from 53.4 to 56.3 percent during 1971 to 1981 and 57.7 to 62.5 per cent during 1991 to 2011. On account of better education, health facilities and increase in life expectancy, the percentage of elderly population (60+) has gone up from 5.3 to 5.7 percent and 6.0 to 8.0 percent respectively during the periods under reference. Marital status and Female mean age at marriage are essential constituents to monitor fertility and population growth. The data on marital status has been included in SRS from 1991, whereas on Female mean age at marriage is from 1990. There is a marginal increase in the proportion of married Female from 45.7 in 1991 to 48.9 in 2011, whereas the proportion of widowed/divorced/separated female has remained stagnant at 8.2. The mean age at effective marriage for Female has improved from 19.3 years in 1990 to 21.2 years in 2011. 2.3 This chapter provides data on percentage distribution of population by age, sex and residence for all broad age groups from 0-4, 0-14, 15-59 and 60+ for India and bigger States. It also includes data on percentage distribution of population by marital status for total population, 10+ and 15+ ages by sex and residence. The state-wise variations in Female age at effective marriage and their corresponding proportions have also been presented in this chapter.},

abstract = {This paper attempts to estimate the housing and real estate wealth effects of households in different income levels. We use the threshold estimation techniques developed in Hansen (1999) to endogenously split the sample by income levels. The data are drawn from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), during the waves of 2001, 2003, and 2005. On housing wealth, the results suggest that there are two significant threshold income levels of {\$}75,000 and {\$}500,000. A one dollar increase in housing wealth increases consumption by 1 cent for households with income below {\$}75,000, and by 3 cents for income between {\$}75,000 and {\$}500,000. If income is above {\$}500,000, the effect is not statistically significant. We also looked at the real estate wealth effect by adding land and other real estate assets to the primary home. For this real estate wealth effect, there are also two significant threshold income levels of {\$}74,000 and {\$}80,000. Below an income level of {\$}74,000, real estate wealth is not a significant determinant of consumption. However, between the two thresholds, the real estate wealth effect is significant, and equal to 2 cents per dollar. Finally the effect is not significant above the second threshold.},

abstract = {This research investigates children's use of two common mouse interaction styles, drag-and-drop and point-and-click, to determine whether the choice of interaction style impacts children's performance in interactive learning environments. The interaction styles were experimentally compared to determine if either method was superior to the other in terms of speed, error rate, or user preference, for children. The two interaction styles were also compared based on children's achievement and motivation, within a commercial software environment. Experiment I used an interactive learning environment as children played two versions of an educational puzzle-solving game, each version utilizing a different mouse interaction style; Experiment II used a mouse-controlled software environment modeled after the educational game. The results were similar to previous results reported for adults: the point-and-click interaction style was faster; fewer errors were committed using it; and it was preferred over the drag-and-drop interaction style. Within the context of the puzzle-solving game, the children solved significantly fewer puzzles, and they were less motivated using the version that utilized a drag-and-drop interaction style as compared to the version that utilized a point-and-click interaction style. These results were also explored through the use of state-transition diagrams and GOMS models, both of which supported the experimental data gathered.},

@book{Cuban2001,
abstract = {Impelled by a demand for increasing American strength in the new global economy, many educators, public officials, business leaders, and parents argue that school computers and Internet access will improve academic learning and prepare students for an information-based workplace. But just how valid is this argument? In "Oversold and Underused," one of the most respected voices in American education argues that when teachers are not given a say in how the technology might reshape schools, computers are merely souped-up typewriters and classrooms continue to run much as they did a generation ago. In his studies of early childhood, high school, and university classrooms in Silicon Valley, Larry Cuban found that students and teachers use the new technologies far less in the classroom than they do at home, and that teachers who use computers for instruction do so infrequently and unimaginatively. Cuban points out that historical and organizational economic contexts influence how teachers use technical innovations. Computers can be useful when teachers sufficiently understand the technology themselves, believe it will enhance learning, and have the power to shape their own curricula. But these conditions can't be met without a broader and deeper commitment to public education beyond preparing workers. More attention, Cuban says, needs to be paid to the civic and social goals of schooling, goals that make the question of how many computers are in classrooms trivial.},

It attempts to critically decode changes in notions and practices of equality and quality in national and international policy prescription, highlighting aspects of ideological contexts, power asymmetries and state dynamics and examines basic shifts in policy discourse and intent. The paper is organised in four parts. The first two parts take a broad historical overview to examine notions of equality and quality, articulated in texts and discussions pertaining to the two national educational policies and in policy initiatives introduced by the Indian state under neoliberal, global hegemonic influence. The interactive impact of educational restructuring and structures of stratification as reflected in the aggravation of key caste, class, gender and ethnic inequalities is captured in the third part of the paper. The final part of the paper draws attention to dilutions and contradictions inherent in recent policy shifts to argue that any meaningful notion of quality education for the poor is impossible to attain in the present context. It unravels the politics of quality.},

Pundits have expressed their opinions from one extreme – physical college campuses will disappear within 10 years – to the other - MOOCs are a bubble which will burst in a few years. Increasing use of technology mediated modes of instruction challenges traditional notions of instructor- learner interaction. This paper will provide an explanation of MOOCs and explore possible realistic scenarios for MOOCS's and the online environment in higher education. The higher education cost and tuition bubble is an important part of online and MOOCs.

abstract = {India has demonstrated considerable progress in the past decade on improving primary school access, infrastructure, pupil-teacher ratios, teacher salaries, and student enrollment. Nevertheless, student learning levels and trajectories are disturbingly low. The past decade has also seen a number of high-quality empirical studies on the causes and correlates of better learning outcomes based on large samples of data and careful attention paid to identification of causal relationships. The findings from this research are however, not being reflected in the current policy priorities of the Government of India. This paper seeks to bridge the gap by summarizing the research, making policy recommendations based on this research, and suggesting an implementation roadmap for the 12th Plan. The main findings reported in this paper are that there is very little evidence to support the notion that improving school inputs in a ‘business as usual' manner will improve learning outcomes. On the other hand, innovations in pedagogy (especially supplemental remedial instruction targeted to the level of learning of children) and governance (focused on teacher performance measurement and management) have shown large positive impacts on student learning. The research over the past decade suggests that increasing inputs to primary education in a ‘business as usual' way are unlikely to improve student learning in a meaningful way unless accompanied by significant changes in pedagogy and/or improvements in school governance.},

For one year we conducted surveys, interviews, and focus groups around sexual harassment with women at three different universities in Dhaka. Based on this input, we developed "Protibadi", a web and mobile phone based application designed to report, map, and share women's stories around sexual harassment in public places. In August 2013 the system launched, user studies were conducted, and public responses were monitored to gauge reactions, strengths, and limits of the system. This paper describes the findings of our ethnographic and design-based work, and suggests lessons relevant to other HCI efforts to understand and design around difficult and culturally sensitive problems.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a burgeoning interest in research into the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the context of developing regions, particularly into how such ICTs might be appropriately designed to meet the unique user and infrastructural requirements that we encounter in these cross-cultural environments. This emerging field, known to some as HCI4D, is the product of a diverse set of origins. As such, it can often be difficult to navigate prior work, and/or to piece together a broad picture of what the field looks like as a whole. In this paper, we aim to contextualize HCI4Dto give it some historical background, to review its existing literature spanning a number of research traditions, to discuss some of its key issues arising from the work done so far, and to suggest some major research objectives for the future.},

abstract = {Global development organizations rely on the essential affordances provided by both paper and digital materials to navigate hurdles posed by poor infrastructure, low connectivity, linguistic differences, and other socioeconomic constraints that render communication and collaboration challenging. This paper examines the collaborative practices around paperdigital workflows within global development organizations operating in lowresource environments. We use a mixed methods approach to gather data from 23 organizations in 16 countries. Our findings show the tensions that arise between the ubiquitousness of paper and the desirability of digitized data, and highlight the challenges associated with transitioning information several times between paper and digital materials. We also reveal design opportunities for new tools to bridge the gap between paperbased and digital information in lowresource settings. Finally, we contribute a nuanced understanding of the crosscultural and infrastructural challenges that influence the paperdigital lifecycle. Our findings will be useful for researchers and practitioners interested in understanding or participating in the workflows that drive global development.},

In industrialized economies, novel sources of data are enabling new approaches to demographic profiling, but in developing countries, fewer sources of big data exist. We show that an individuals past history of mobile phone use can be used to infer his or her socioeconomic status. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the predicted attributes of millions of individuals can, in turn, accurately reconstruct the distribution of wealth of an entire nation or to infer the asset distribution of microregions composed of just a few households. In resource-constrained environments where censuses and household surveys are rare, this approach creates an option for gathering localized and timely information at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods.},

abstract = {This article focuses on a collection of public videos posted to YouTube by a teenage girlwho calls herself “mememolly.” Drawing on case study observation and documentation of roughly 18 months of her posting life on YouTube, the ar- ticle concentrates on how mememolly constructs her online self through the language-mediated practices of her YouTube communications. Ap- plying notions of performance, simulation, and subjectivity, the article suggests thatmemem- olly's case offers an instructive backdrop from which to take up the possibilities, effects, and consequences of creating oneself on YouTube. Formememolly, YouTube serves as a space to en- act performances of a routinely changing and changeable self, to simulate fantasies and desires of becoming, and to explore a series of plea- sures. More so, it allows her the opportunity to narrate various aspects of her life, to reflexively document these narrations for posterity, and to comment on her world in ways that coexist and compete with her ideas about hermaterial exis- tence. Young peoplewho make videos in online spaces like YouTube can animate discursive no- tions of youth, her story suggests, by inviting us to investigate what an experience of being young might entail and how itmight be expressed when made within a space wheremultiple simulations of self are possible.},

abstract = {While some in the CSCW community have researched the values in technology design and engineering practices, the underlying ideologies that reinforce and protect those values remain under-explored. This paper seeks to address this gap by identifying a common ideological framework that appears across four engineering endeavors: the OLPC Project, the National Day of Civic Hacking, the Fixit Clinic, and the Stanford d.school. We found that all four of these communities utilized elements of religious practice to affirm their membership and shared vision. We describe the forms of worship we saw in these engineering worlds, their practices of evangelism, and the ways in which they addressed doubt. We also demonstrate the role mythologies play as ideologically charged narratives. Our discussion of these parallels illuminates the extent and consequences of quasi-religious practices in engineering worlds and illustrates the utility of using religion as a ‘lens' for understanding ideological commitments in engineering culture.},

abstract = {The One Laptop per Child (OLPC) program is one of the most ambitious educational reform initiatives the world has ever seen. The program has developed a radically new low-cost laptop computer and aggressively promoted its plans to put the computer in the hands of hundreds of millions of children around the world, including in the most impoverished nations. Though fewer than 2 million of OLPC's XO computers have been distributed as of this writing, the initiative has caught the attention of world leaders, influenced developments in the global computer industry and sparked controversy and debate about the best way to improve the lot of the world's poor. With six years having passed since Nicholas Negroponte first unveiled the idea, this paper appraises the program's progress and impact and, in so doing, takes afresh look at OLPC's assumptions. The paper reviews the theoretical underpinnings of OLPC, analyzes the program's development and summarizes the current state of OLPC deployments around the world. The analysis reveals that provision of individual laptops is a Utopian vision for the children in the poorest countries, whose educational and social futures could be more effectively improved if the same investments were instead made on more sustainable and proven interventions. Middle- and high-income countries may have a stronger rationale for providing individual laptops to children, but will still want to eschew OLPC's technocentric vision. In summary, OLPC represents the latest in a long line of technologically Utopian development schemes that have unsuccessfully attempted to solve complex social problems with overly simplistic solutions.},

We present a study comparing the persuasive power of two speech-based information systems, one which uses a recorded message-based lecture presentation and another which uses an interactive dialogic presentation. We measure the persuasive power across both conditions using a survival task. We find that the dialogic system is significantly more persuasive than the lecture system. We also find that the dialogic system presents significantly (almost four times) less information than the lecture system. We analyze our results using three standard rank correlation methods. We point to limitations of these measures and propose a new metric which appears to be more sensitive for this task.},

Two common underlying themes emerge from these studies: (1) local stakeholders can contribute cultural information relevant to design such as needs and practices through interaction with technology artifacts and (2) unique social network structures embedded within communities are crucial to the acceptance and potential adoption of technology. We end with a synthesis of the three experiences that draws some practical lessons for ICT designers to elicit meaningful feedback and participation from local stakeholders in developing regions communities.},

abstract = {The first decade of the 21st century was marked by rapid change, market interdependencies, environmental awareness, social cohesion, and the rise of young generations as key influencers of global change at the political, economic and social levels. The Internet and technological inventions of this period served as fuel and catalyst for these events, but also contributed massively to radical changes in traditional approaches to the fields of research, science, and education. At Cisco, we believe that high-quality education and technology have the power to change the world by developing the human talent required to seize the opportunities that arise from global change. Cisco's Global Education group helps governments and institutions worldwide achieve their education 3.0 vision through the use of technology and the development of the higher-order capabilities required in 21st century learners. Video, as a fundamental agent in the process of education transformation, facilitates collaboration, accommodates for different learning styles, increases engagement and excitement among students, helps maximize school and university resources, and improves learning outcomes. In an effort to collect existing research and document the benefits of video in improving learning and the overall quality of the classroom experience, I am happy to introduce this paper and share it with the wider global community of teachers, school officials, administrators, decision makers, and education stakeholders. The paper draws on multiple studies conducted in recent years, and also on the results of Cisco's worldwide experience helping education institutions implement video technologies. The paper encourages readers to see video technologies as an enabler and a complementary tool for high-quality 21st century education. In order to maximize the gains of video, it is imperative to have a forward-looking pedagogy, a solid professional development program for teachers, and true integration of video technology with curricula. As the world continues its journey into the second decade of the century, the propagation of video technologies in education is poised to accelerate because of the proliferation of portable devices and the explosion of Internet and mobile phone users. Also driving adoption are the increased understanding and appreciation for these types of technologies by young people, as well as their constant desire to interact and collaborate at any time beyond the classroom and campus' walls. The opportunity is clear, the technology is here, and the timing is right. It is now up to us to responsibly adopt video technologies in the classroom, guiding our students on how to best profit from them and contributing to the development of the appropriate skill sets that will help th},

Yet science policy debates have long been dominated by advocates for particular scientific fields or missions. In the absence of a deeper understanding of the changing framework in which innovation occurs, policymakers cannot predict how best to make and manage investments to exploit our most promising and important opportunities. Since 2005, a science of science policy has developed rapidly in response to policymakers' increased demands for better tools and the social sciences' capacity to provide them. The Science of Science Policy: A Handbook brings together some of the best and brightest minds working in science policy to explore the foundations of an evidence-based platform for the field. The contributions in this book provide an overview of the current state of the science of science policy from three angles: theoretical, empirical, and policy in practice. They offer perspectives from the broader social science, behavioral science, and policy communities on the fascinating challenges and prospects in this evolving arena. Drawing on domestic and international experiences, the text delivers insights about the critical questions that create a demand for a science of science policy.},

abstract = {Computer-aided learning is fast gaining traction in developing regions as a means to augment classroom instruction. Reasons for using computer-aided learning range from supplementing teacher shortages to starting underprivileged children off in technology, and funding for such initiatives range from state education funds to international agencies and private groups interested in child development. The interaction of children with computers is seen at various levels, from unsupervised self-guided learning at public booths without specific curriculum to highly regulated in-class computer applications with modules designed to go with school curriculum. Such learning is used at various levels from children as young as 5 year-old to high-schoolers. This paper uses field observations of primary school children in India using computer-aided learning modules, and finds patterns by which children who perform better in classroom activities seat themselves in front of computer monitors, and control the mouse, in cases where children are required to share computer resources. We find that in such circumstances, there emerges a pattern of learning, unique to multi-user environments - wherein certain children tend to learn better because of their control of the mouse. This research also shows that while computer aided learning software for children is primarily designed for single-users, the implementation realities of resource-strapped learning environments in developing regions presents a strong case for multi-user design.},

abstract = {Learning to read in a second language is challenging, but highly rewarding. For low-income children in developing countries, this task can be significantly more challenging because of lack of access to high-quality schooling, but can potentially improve economic prospects at the same time. A synthesis of research findings suggests that practicing recalling and vocalizing words for expressing an intended meaning could improve word reading skills - including reading in a second language - more than silent recognition of what the given words mean. Unfortunately, many language learning software do not support this instructional approach, owing to the technical challenges of incorporating speech recognition support to check that the learner is vocalizing the correct word. In this paper, we present results from a usability test and two subsequent experiments that explore the use of two speech recognition-enabled mobile games to help rural children in India read words with understanding. Through a working speech recognition prototype, we discuss two major contributions of this work: first, we give empirical evidence that shows the extent to which productive training (i.e. vocalizing words) is superior to receptive vocabulary training, and discuss the use of scaffolding hints to "unpack" factors in the learner's linguistic knowledge that may impact reading. Second, we discuss what our results suggest for future research in HCI.},

abstract = {While mobile phones have found broad application in bringing health, financial, and other services to the developing world, usability remains a major hurdle for novice and low-literacy populations. In this article, we take two steps to evaluate and improve the usability of mobile interfaces for such users. First, we offer an ethnographic study of the usability barriers facing 90 low-literacy subjects in India, Kenya, the Philippines, and South Africa. Then, via two studies involving over 70 subjects in India, we quantitatively compare the usability of different points in the mobile design space. In addition to text interfaces such as electronic forms, SMS, and USSD, we consider three text-free interfaces: a spoken dialog system, a graphical interface, and a live operator. Our results confirm that textual interfaces are unusable by first-time low-literacy users, and error prone for literate but novice users. In the context of healthcare, we find that a live operator is up to ten times more accurate than text-based interfaces, and can also be cost effective in countries such as India. In the context of mobile banking, we find that task completion is highest with a graphical interface, but those who understand the spoken dialog system can use it more quickly due to their comfort and familiarity with speech. We synthesize our findings into a set of design recommendations.},

abstract = {Rural communities in India are often underserved by the mainstream media. While there is a public discourse surrounding the issues they face, this dialogue typically takes place on television, in newspaper editorials, and on the Internet. Unfortunately, participation in such forums is limited to the most privileged members of society, excluding those individuals who have the largest stake in the conversation. This paper examines an effort to foster a more inclusive dialogue by means of a simple technology: an interactive voice forum. Called CGNet Swara, the system enables callers to record messages of local interest, and listen to messages that others have recorded. Messages are also posted on the Internet, as a supplement to an existing discussion forum. In the first 21 months of its deployment in India, CGNet Swara has logged over 70,000 phone calls and released 1,100 messages. To understand the emergent practices surrounding this system, we conduct interviews with 42 diverse stakeholders, including callers, bureaucrats, and members of the media. Our analysis contributes to the understanding of voice-based media as a vehicle for social inclusion in remote and underprivileged populations.},

Our results with 5 families show that Kurator can reduce the amount of effort needed to find meaningful memories within a large collection. This work also suggests that crowdsourcing can be used effectively even in domains where personal preference is key to accurately solving the task.},

@article{Kotturi2015,
abstract = {When students work with peers, they learn more actively, build richer knowledge structures, and connect material to their lives. However, not every peer learning experience online sees successful adoption. This paper articulates and addresses three adoption challenges for global-scale peer learning. First, peer interactions struggle to bootstrap critical mass. However, class incentives can signal importance and spur initial usage. Second, online classes have limited peer visibility and awareness, so students often feel alone even when surrounded by peers. We find that highlighting interdependence and strengthening norms can mitigate this issue. Third, teachers can readily access "big" aggregate data but not "thick" contextual data that helps build intuitions, so software should guide teachers' scaffolding of peer interactions. We illustrate these challenges through studying 8,500 students' usage of two peer learning platforms, Talkabout and PeerStudio. This paper measures efficacy through sign-up and participation rates and the structure and duration of student interactions.},

abstract = {Online communities enable people to easily connect and share knowledge across geographies. Mobile phones can en- able billions of new users in emerging countries to participate in these online communities. In India, where social hierarchy is important, usersmay over-value institutionally-recognized authorities relative to peer-sourced content. We tested this hypothesis through a controlled experiment of source au- thority effects on a voice-based agricultural information ser- vice for farmers in Gujarat, India. 305 farmers were sent seven agricultural tips via automated phone calls over a two- week period. The same seven tips were each voice-recorded by two university scientists and two peer farmers. Partici- pants received a preview of the tip from a randomly assigned source via the automated call, and played the remainder of the tip by calling a dedicated phone number. Participants called the follow-up number significantly more often when the tip preview was recorded by a peer than a scientist. On the other hand, in interviews conducted both before and af- ter the experiment, a majority of farmers maintained that they preferred receiving information from scientists. This stated preference may have been expressing the more so- cially acceptable response. We interpret our experimental results as a demonstration of the demand for peer-based agricultural information dissemination. We conclude with design implications for peer-to-peer information services for rural communities in India.},

ODK Collect is a mobile platform that renders forms that support complex interaction logic and manipulation of data types like text, location, images, audio, video, and barcodes. ODK Aggregate provides an easy to deploy server that supports data storage and transfer in the “cloud” or on local servers. ODK Voice renders applications using automated phone prompts that users respond to with keypad presses. Finally, ODK Build is a simple drag-and-drop form designer that generates the application logic used by the tools. Designed to be used together or independently, ODK tools build on existing open standards and empower individuals and organizations to build services that push and pull information in the developing world. Additionally, ODK is supported by an open-source community which has contributed training documents, localization support, and additional tools. We describe four ongoing deployments covering a wide variety of domains that demonstrate how the design decisions made in the system architecture of ODK enable a powerful new class of applications. Finally, we discuss future research directions using this platform.},

We instantiate this idea in Atelier, a micro-internship platform that connects crowd interns with crowd mentors. Atelier guides mentor–intern pairs to break down expert crowdsourcing tasks into milestones, review intermediate output, and problem-solve together. We conducted a field experiment comparing Atelier's mentorship model to a non-mentored alternative on a real-world programming crowdsourcing task, finding that Atelier helped interns maintain forward progress and absorb best practices.},

abstract = {Technology increasingly allows us to capture and revisit rich digital records of our lives, processes which we call Technology Mediated Memory (TMM). We explore whether TMM alters unmediated remembering and also whether such changes affect psychological well-being. Human memory biases promote well-being by adaptively editing our memories, making them more positive. In contrast, TMM often provides rich records of what people actually did and felt, which could disrupt adaptive edits. To explore this, we developed a smartphone-based personal TMM application, Echo, that allows participants to record and later reflect on everyday events. In a month-long deployment, 64 users made over 3200 recordings and reflections. We found that although Echo TMM alters how we remember, these changes remain adaptive. Instead of compromising adaptive biases, Echo TMM helps well-being and benefits are sustained long-term. Logfile analysis shows that participants use Echo strategically to prospectively edit by initially reporting events positively to anticipate future viewing. Participants also distance themselves from past negative events by reflecting more positively than at recording. We discuss design and theoretical implications.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing systems accomplish large tasks with scale and speed by breaking work down into independent parts. However, many types of complex creative work, such as fic-tion writing, have remained out of reach for crowds because work is tightly interdependent: changing one part of a story may trigger changes to the overall plot and vice versa. Tak-ing inspiration from how expert authors write, we propose a technique for achieving interdependent complex goals with crowds. With this technique, the crowd loops between reflec-tion, to select a high-level goal, and revision, to decompose that goal into low-level, actionable tasks. We embody this approach in Mechanical Novel, a system that crowdsources short fiction stories on Amazon Mechanical Turk. In a field experiment, Mechanical Novel resulted in higher-quality sto-ries than an iterative crowdsourcing workflow. Our findings suggest that orienting crowd work around high-level goals may enable workers to coordinate their effort to accomplish complex work.},

abstract = {In families composed of parents and children, the health of parents and children is often interrelated: the health of children can have an impact on the health of parents, and vice versa. However, the design of health tracking technologies typically focuses on individual self-tracking and self-management, not yet addressing family health in a unified way. To examine opportunities for family-centered health informatics, we interviewed 14 typically healthy families, interviewed 10 families with a child with a chronic condition, and conducted three participatory design sessions with children aged 7 to 11. Although we identified similarities between family-centered tracking and personal self-tracking, we also found families want to: (1) identify ripple effects between family members; (2) consider both caregivers and children as trackers to support distributing the burdens of tracking across family members; and (3) identify and pursue health guidelines that consider the state of their family (e.g., specific health guidelines for families that include a child with a chronic condition). We contribute to expanding the design lens from self-tracking to family-centered health tracking.},

abstract = {Background: Opposing groups of scientists have recently engaged in a heated dispute over a preliminary European Commission (EC) report on its regulatory policy for endocrine-disrupting chemicals. In addition to the scientific issues at stake, a central question has been how scientists can maintain their objectivity when informing policy makers.Objectives: Drawing from current ethical, conceptual, and empirical studies of objectivity and conflicts of interest in scientific research, we propose guiding principles for communicating scientific findings in a manner that promotes objectivity, public trust, and policy relevance.Discussion: Both conceptual and empirical studies of scientific reasoning have shown that it is unrealistic to prevent policy-relevant scientific research from being influenced by value judgments. Conceptually, the current dispute over the EC report illustrates how scientists are forced to make value judgments about appropriate standards of evidence when informing public policy. Empirical studies provide further evidence that scientists are unavoidably influenced by a variety of potentially subconscious financial, social, political, and personal interests and values.Conclusions: When scientific evidence is inconclusive and major regulatory decisions are at stake, it is unrealistic to think that values can be excluded from scientific reasoning. Thus, efforts to suppress or hide interests or values may actually damage scientific objectivity and public trust, whereas a willingness to bring implicit interests and values into the open may be the best path to promoting good science and policy.Citation: Elliott KC, Resnik DB. 2014.

abstract = {When people try to understand complex physical devices (e.g., a sewing machine), they proceed in an iterative fashion. They seem to reach several points at which they claim to "understand" the device. Each point of understanding is incomplete and requires a new level of understanding. As a result, they cycle between understanding and non-understanding as they traverse different levels. The present study provides a framework to capture the iterative nature of understanding. These points are discussed and illustrated through observations of three pairs of people constructively interacting to understand how a sewing machine works. In addition to the iterative search for understanding, the conceptual point in space from which the speaker appeared to be viewing the machine was important. This conceptual point of view (C-POV) was reflected in their use of language. The C-POV appeared to be stable during points of understanding and to shift frequently at points of non-understanding. ?? 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Students worked individually, using investigator-provided generic questions to guide them in generating their own task-specific questions. Following this self-questioning phase, they worked in small cooperative groups, taking turns posing their questions to each other and answering each other's questions. This procedure was designed to promote the kind of verbal interaction that has been found to benefit learning in small groups, namely, giving elaborated explanations. Results indicated that students using this guided reciprocal peer-questioning procedure asked more critical thinking (vs. recall) questions, gave more explanations (vs. low-level elaboration responses), and demonstrated higher achievement than students using a discussion approach (Experiment 1) or those using an unguided reciprocal peer-questioning approach (Experiment 2). Guided reciprocal peer-questioning appears to promote peer interaction and learning in cooperative groups by controlling the quality of questioning, which in turn shapes peer responses.},

Mapping question quality onto the levels in the cognitive domain of Bloom's taxonomy, we find that students produce questions of high quality. More than three-quarters of questions fall into categories beyond simple recall, in contrast to similar studies of student-authored content in different subject domains. Similarly, the quality of student-authored explanations for questions was also high, with approximately 60{\%} of all explanations classified as being of high or outstanding quality. Overall, 75{\%} of questions met combined quality criteria, which we hypothesize is due in part to the in-class scaffolding activities that we provided for students ahead of requiring them to author questions. This work presents the first systematic investigation into the quality of student produced assessment material in an introductory physics context, and thus complements and extends related studies in other disciplines.},

The success of VCS projects has prompted researchers to understand what motivates volunteer participation. 199 registered users of Zooniverse, a successful collection of VCS projects, completed a web survey assessing various possible motives for their participation. An exploratory factor analysis of their responses suggests a three-factor solution representing motives related to Social Engagement, Interaction with the Website, and Helping. We discuss the place these results have in helping to understand the still emerging picture of the variety of motives associated with various VCS projects and activities.},

abstract = {Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) is an emerging branch of the learning sciences concerned with studying how people can learn together with the help of computers. As we will see in this essay, such a simple statement conceals considerable complexity. The interplay of learning with technology turns out to be quite intricate. The inclusion of collaboration, computer mediation and distance education has problematized the very notion of learning and called into question prevailing assumptions about how to study it. Like many active fields of scientific research, CSCL has a complex relationship to established disciplines, evolves in ways that are hard to pinpoint and includes important contributions that seem incompatible. The field of CSCL has a long history of controversy about its theory, methods and definition. Furthermore, it is important to view CSCL as a vision of what may be possible with computers and of what kinds of research should be conducted, rather than as an established body of broadly accepted laboratory and classroom practices. We will start from some popular understandings of the issues of CSCL and gradually reveal its more complex nature. We will review CSCL's historical development and offer our perspective on its future},

abstract = {One technology for education whose adoption is currently expanding rapidly in UK higher education is that of electronic voting systems (EVS). As with all educational technology, whether learning benefits are achieved depends not on the technology but on whether an improved teaching method is introduced with it. EVS inherently relies on the multiple-choice question (MCQ) format, which many feel is associated with the lowest kind of learning of disconnected facts. This paper, however, discusses several ways in which teaching with MCQs, and so with EVS, has transcended this apparent disadvantage, has based itself on deep learning in the sense of focusing on learning relationships between items rather than on recalling disconnected true–false items, and so has achieved substantial learning advantages. Six possible learning designs based on MCQs are discussed, and a new function for (e-)assessment is identified, namely catalytic assessment, where the purpose of test questions is to trigger subsequent deep learning without direct teaching input.},

Within this general research programme, we concentrate on the specific case of argumentative interactions, with the aim of describing how they can be constructive. A constructive interaction is defined as one in which new meanings or knowledge are co- elaborated, and/or one that fulfils some specific (constructive) function with respect to cooperative activity. Our main proposal is that in order to address this research problem we need to combine analyses of argumentative interactions along five theoretically separable dimensions: dialectical, rhetorical, epistemological, conceptual and interactive. Respectively, these consider argumentative interactions in terms of rational criticism, cognitive effects on participants, the nature of knowledge involved, the form of cognitive representations and co- elaboration of meaning and knowledge. We present a detailed analysis of an extended interaction sequence, taken from a corpus that was collected in a physics classroom. The analysis reveals how the interactive pressure imposed by the necessity to resolve interpersonal conflicts forces meanings and knowledge to evolve, and the basic function of argumentation in this context: filtering flawed proposals.},

Hypotheses of the model were tested in two experiments where learners engaged in trialogues on scientific reasoning concepts in a simulated collaborative learning session with animated agents playing the role of a tutor and a peer student. Confusion was experimentally induced via a contradictory-information manipulation involving the animated agents expressing incorrect and/or contradictory opinions and asking the (human) learners to decide which opinion had more scientific merit. The results indicated that self-reports of confusion were largely insensitive to the manipulations. However, confusion was manifested by more objective measures that inferred confusion on the basis of learners' responses immediately following contradictions. Furthermore, whereas the contradictions had no effect on learning when learners were not confused by the manipulations, performance on multiple-choice posttests and on transfer tests was substantially higher when the contradictions were successful in confusing learners. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This article is designed to provide an overview of this new field for the general psychologist.

Implications are that behavioral-psychological processes ought to be capable of altering immune function and that events that occur as part of immune responses should modulate behavior. Evidence for influences in both of these directions is reviewed. The discussion of psychological modulation of immunity focuses on classical conditioning and stress, whereas that of immune modification of behavior highlights behavioral effects produced by substances released by the immune system. Finally, the adaptive role that such changes might play is considered.},

A newly identified factor, the gut microbiota, which is a bacterial ecosystem residing within the gastrointestinal tract of humans, has now been implicated in the obesity epidemic. Importantly, this bacterial community is impacted by external environmental factors through a variety of undefined mechanisms. We focus this review on how the external environment may impact the gut microbiota by considering, the host's geographic location 'human geography', and behavioral factors (diet and physical activity). Moreover, we explore the relationship between the gut microbiota and obesity with these external factors. And finally, we highlight here how an epidemiologic model can be utilized to elucidate causal relationships between the gut microbiota and external environment independently and collectively, and how this will help further define this important new factor in the obesity epidemic.},

The majority of students in both years either agreed or strongly agreed that both authoring and answering questions was helpful for their studies and wanted to use the system again in future courses. Thematic analysis highlighted students' views that engaging with the resource increased breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding and was very useful for revision purposes. There was a statistically significant difference between students in second and third year regarding whether students felt it was necessary for academic staff to be involved in the review process. Thematic analysis of this aspect identified issues relating to confidence in the ability of the peer group and the need for reassurance in the second-year group. Student engagement with the system was correlated with examination performance. In courses A and B there was a positive correlation between number of questions answered and examination performance, in course C there was no correlation. This study highlights the benefits of peer activity around question generation and proposes that such activities are an efficient and effective means to support student learning.},

abstract = {Humans are virtually identical in their genetic makeup, yet the small differences in our DNA give rise to tremendous phenotypic diversity across the human population. By contrast, the metagenome of the human microbiome—the total DNA content of microbes inhabiting our bodies—is quite a bit more variable, with only a third of its constituent genes found in a majority of healthy individuals. Understanding this variability in the “healthy microbiome” has thus been a major challenge in microbiome research, dating back at least to the 1960s, continuing through the Human Microbiome Project and beyond. Cataloguing the necessary and sufficient sets of microbiome features that support health, and the normal ranges of these features in healthy populations, is an essential first step to identifying and correcting microbial configurations that are implicated in disease. Toward this goal, several population-scale studies have documented the ranges and diversity of both taxonomic compositions and functional potentials normally observed in the microbiomes of healthy populations, along with possible driving factors such as geography, diet, and lifestyle. Here, we review several definitions of a ‘healthy microbiome' that have emerged, the current understanding of the ranges of healthy microbial diversity, and gaps such as the characterization of molecular function and the development of ecological therapies to be addressed in the future.},

Students in both conditions posed their questions to their small-group peers and answered each other's questions. On tests of lecture comprehension students who generated their own questions outperformed students provided with others' questions. Locus of control was also a predictor of performance. Internals allowed to generate their own questions performed better on comprehension tests than internals provided with others' questions.

This balanced approach to metacognition concerns itself with many aspects of student development, ranging from academic competence to knowledge about the self-as-learner. In this article, I examine two basic approaches to supporting metacognition: (a) strategy training and (b) creation of a supportive social environment for metacognition. There are also two kinds of content that are taught using these two approaches: (a) knowledge about a specific domain and (b) knowledge about the self-as-learner. These approaches and contents have been used frequently in metacognitive interventions over the past two decades. Each offers unique contributions to metacognitive development. However, programs that address these approaches and contents simultaneously are rare. Maintaining the coordination, on one hand, between strategy training and creating social supports, and on the other hand, between knowledge about the subject domain and knowledge about the self-as-learner, is a challenge for most design efforts in metacognition. Future design issues include: (a) developing a system approach to promote coordination among these approaches and contents; and (b) finding ways to build knowledge about the self-as-learner.},

abstract = {In trying to determine how people use interactive computer systems, many of us invest a considerable amount of time and energy to find out how users work and how they interact both with each other and with the computer.  We want to know what they think about the interactive systems we provide for them (and sometimes in cooperation with them) and what we can do to make these systems fit their needs.$\backslash$nThis article focuses on how the constructive interaction method helps system designers determine whether the basic concepts underlying a system are well understood by users and whether its implementation, usability, and utility are satisfactory.  We describe our experiences in using a form of constructive interaction to test a software package that supports a particular collaborative activity.  The difference between our use of the constructive interaction method versus other models is that our test subjects use separate workstations in the same room to discuss their common tasks.  Having thus adjusted the setting to the specific characteristics of computer-supported collaborative work, we asked each person to carry out separate sets of predefined tasks that were linked.},

abstract = {When they, as members of the interaction design community, think about citizen science, they tend to envision people collecting, sharing, and acting on local data. Some of them might recall the famous success stories: the Christmas Bird Count, the longest-running citizen-driven bird census, or Project Budburst, which tracks environmental changes by monitoring plant lifecycles. Inspired by these and other examples, HCI research often discusses citizen science as non-experts acting as scientists. DIYbio (do-it-yourself biology) is a growing community of hobbyists, artists, hackers, and scientists experimenting with biology outside of professional laboratories. From independent bioartists, to meet-ups of hobbyists and professionals, biotech non-profits, and fully functional grassroots laboratories, the "garage biology" movement is reconfiguring and tinkering with organic materials and systems. Expanding the HCI community's view of citizen science to incorporate varying degrees of expertise could enable people to envision new types of sensing systems.},

abstract = {Current practice in Human Computer Interaction as encouraged by educational institutes, academic review processes, and institutions with usability groups advocate usability evaluation as a critical part of every design process. This is for good reason: usability evaluation has a significant role to play when conditions warrant it. Yet evaluation can be ineffective and even harmful if naively done 'by rule' rather than 'by thought'. If done during early stage design, it can mute creative ideas that do not conform to current interface norms. If done to test radical innovations, the many interface issues that would likely arise from an immature technology can quash what could have been an inspired vision. If done to validate an academic prototype, it may incorrectly suggest a design's scientific worthiness rather than offer a meaningful critique of how it would be adopted and used in everyday practice. If done without regard to how cultures adopt technology over time, then today's reluctant reactions by users will forestall tomorrow's eager acceptance. The choice of evaluation methodology - if any - must arise from and be appropriate for the actual problem or research question under consideration.},

abstract = {We explore the connections between machine learning and human learning in one form of semi-supervised classification. 22 human subjects completed a novel 2- class categorization task in which they were first taught to categorize a single labeled example from each cate- gory, and subsequently were asked to categorize, with- out feedback, a large set of additional items. Stimuli were visually complex and unrecognizable shapes. The unlabeled examples were sampled from a bimodal dis- tribution with modes appearing either to the left (left- shift condition) or right (right-shift condition) of the two labeled examples. Results showed that, although initial decision boundaries were near the middle of the two labeled examples, after exposure to the unlabeled examples, they shifted in different directions in the two groups. In this respect, the human behavior conformed well to the predictions of a Gaussian mixture model for semi-supervised learning. The human behavior differed from model predictions in other interesting respects, suggesting some fruitful avenues for future inquiry. Introduction},

To map out the role of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) across these seams, we present design exercises (functional prototypes) that explore three areas for future work: internal collaboration tools within the DIYbio and professional community; mechanisms for external communication with stakeholders from the general public; and bio-electronic assemblies of organic and digital materials.

abstract = {Studies of the human microbiome have revealed that even healthy individuals differ remarkably in the microbes that occupy habitats such as the gut, skin and vagina. Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics and early microbial exposure have all been implicated. Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analysed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats so far. We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat's signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals. The project encountered an estimated 81-99{\%} of the genera, enzyme families and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome. Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associations of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata. These results thus delineate the range of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial communities of a healthy population, enabling future characterization of the epidemiology, ecology and translational applications of the human microbiome.},

The possibility of this data promises a breadth of new service opportunities for improving people's lives through deep personalization, tools to manage aspects of their personal wellbeing, and services that support identity construction. However, the way that this data is collected and managed today introduces several challenges that severely limit the utility of this rich data. This thesis maps out a computational ecosystem for personal behavioral data through the design, implementation, and evaluation of Phenom, a web service that factors out common activities in making inferences from personal behavioral data. The primary benefits of Phenom include: a structured process for aggregating and representing user data; support for developing models based on personal behavioral data; and a unified API for accessing inferences made by models within Phenom. To evaluate Phenom for ease of use and versatility, an external set of developers will create example applications with it.},

The gap exists because of many reasons like subjective mapping between the two, lack of resources to implement the action, or inherent noise in the physical processes. The proposed system observes the action and infers the intention behind it. The system then generates a refined action using the inference. The inferred intention and the refined action are then provided as feedback to the user who can then perform corrective actions or choose the refined action as it is as the desired result. I demonstrate the design and implementation of such systems through five projects - Image Deblurring, Tracking Block Model Assembly, Animating with Physical Proxies, What Affects Handwriting and Spying on the Writer.},

abstract = {Designing an effective and sustainable citizen science (CS) project requires consideration of a great number of factors. This makes the overall process unpredictable, even when a sound, user-centred design approach is followed by an experienced team of UX designers. Moreover, when such systems are deployed, the complexity of the resulting interactions challenges any attempt to generalisation from retrospective analysis. In this paper, we present a case study of the largest single platform of citizen driven data analysis projects to date, the Zooniverse. By eliciting, through structured reflection, experiences of core members of its design team, our grounded analysis yielded four sets of themes, focusing on Task Specificity, Community Development, Task Design and Public Relations and Engagement, supported by two-to-four specific design claims each. For each, we propose a set of design claims (DCs), drawing comparisons to the literature on crowdsourcing and online communities to contextualise our findings.},

abstract = {Here we describe the critical role that synchrotron X-ray and infrared microprobes are playing in the search for interstellar dust in the Stardust Interstellar Dust Collector (SIDC). The samples under examination are submicron particles trapped in low-density aerogel. We have found that the spatial resolution, energy range, and flux capabilities of the FTIR beamlines 1.4.3, ALS, and U2B, NSLS; the XRF microprobes ID13 and ID22NI, ESRF and 2-ID-D, APS; and the STXM beamline 11.0.2, ALS are ideally suited for studying these tiny returned samples. Using nondestructive, coordinated analyses at these microprobes, we have been able to eliminate most candidates as likely samples of interstellar dust. This in itself is a major accomplishment, since the analysis of these tiny samples is technically extremely challenging.},

abstract = {Research on students' learning in computing typically inves- tigates how to enable individuals to develop concepts and skills, yet many forms of computing education, from peer instruction to robotics competitions, involve group work in which understanding may not be entirely locatable within individuals' minds. We need theories and methods that al- low us to understand learning in cognitive systems: cultur- ally and historically situated groups of students, teachers, and tools. Accordingly, we draw on Hutchins' Distributed Cognition [16] theory to present a qualitative case study analysis of interaction and learning within a small group of middle school students programming computer music. Our analysis shows how a system of students, teachers, and tools, working in a music classroom, is able to accomplish con- ceptually demanding computer music programming. We show how the system does this by 1) collectively drawing on individuals' knowledge, 2) using the physical and virtual a ordances of di erent tools to organize work, externalize knowledge, and create new demands for problem solving, and 3) recon guring relationships between individuals and tools over time as the focus of problem solving changes. We discuss the implications of this perspective for research on teaching, learning and assessment in computing.},

The underlying distribution of student solutions submitted in response to a particular assignment may be complex, but the newly available volume of student solutions represents a denser sampling of that distribution. Working with large datasets of students' solutions, I am building systems with user interfaces that allow teachers to explore the variety of their students' correct and incorrect solutions. Forum posts, grading rubrics, and automatic graders can be based on student solution data, and turn massive engineering and computer science classrooms into useful insight and feedback for teachers.

However, users' interac-tions with their internal representations, including their ex-pectations about data, are also critical for a visualization to support learning. We present multiple graphically-based tech-niques for eliciting and incorporating a user's prior knowledge about data into visualization interaction. We use controlled experiments to evaluate how graphically eliciting forms of prior knowledge and presenting feedback on the gap between prior knowledge and the observed data impacts a user's ability to recall and understand the data. We find that participants who are prompted to reflect on their prior knowledge by pre-dicting and self-explaining data outperform a control group in recall and comprehension. These effects persist when partici-pants have moderate or little prior knowledge on the datasets. We discuss how the effects differ based on text versus visual presentations of data. We characterize the design space of graphical prediction and feedback techniques and describe design recommendations.},

@article{Kulkarni2014a,
abstract = {At a doctoral symposium in 2014 Kulkarni presented a conversation about "peer opportunities for learning at scale". Inspired by the powerful role peers play in traditional classrooms Kulkani proposes to leverage interactions amongst students. Extending the argument that peer interactions shift students from ‘automatic' thinking to more ‘active, effortful, conscious' thinking, which aids learning and growth [6]. Kulkarni claims 'that connecting students with the diverse experience levels and viewpoints of their global peer group peers improves learning outcomes'. Arguing 'for the co-development of pedagogical strategy and supporting software systems that are designed for scale and diversity' Kulkarni discusses how codevelopment of software and pedagogy can create 'novel educational experiences that not only leverage diversity and scale, but would be impossible without them'. The large scale of online classes and the diversity of the students that participate in them can enable new educational systems. This massive scale and diversity can enable always-available systems that help students share diverse ideas, and inspire and learn from each other. We introduce systems for two core educational processes at scale: discussion and assessment. To date, several thousand students in a dozen online classes have used our discussion system. Controlled experiments suggest that participants in more diverse discussions perform better on tests and that discussion improves engagement. Similarly, more than 100,000 students have reviewed peer work for both summative assessment and feedback. Through these systems, we argue that to create new educational experiences at scale, pedagogical strategies and software that leverage scale and diversity must be co-developed. More broadly, we suggest the key to creating new educational experiences online lies in leveraging massive networks of peers.},

We present DocMatrix, an interface for viewing multiple documents in parallel, with three key features: a grid of document viewers, a common term sidebar, and enhanced tables of contents. It is designed to let an interested learner view, filter, highlight, and search many documents on a topic simultaneously.

The results of this study in- dicate DocMatrix allowed users to find, read, and synthesize more information than a traditional single-book interface.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of national culture on the structured knowledge transfer from a US-based (onshore) technical support center to an offshore support center in China. Design/methodology/approach – The research was conducted as an interpretive case study. Three techniques (i.e. document review, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews) were employed for data collection in the field. Findings – The findings identify that knowledge tacitness, knowledge gaps, cultural and communication difficulties and weak relationships were the critical barriers to successful knowledge transfer in a cross-cultural knowledge transfer context. It was found that, when a provider and a recipient are located in different individualism/collectivism, power distance, and uncertainty avoidance cultural dimensions, there will be a reduced likelihood of successful knowledge transfer in a structured knowledge transfer process. However, peer-to-peer help, close relationships and proactive learning may assist in decreasing the knowledge transfer difficulties. Research limitations/implications – The research was limited to one organization in one industry (the IT support industry) and in one country (China). There could be both industry-specific issues and national cultural issues that may affect the findings and conclusions. However, the paper has important practical implications for organizations that are trying to carry out transfer of organizational knowledge or to acquire organizational knowledge in a cross-cultural business context. Originality/value – The findings provide insight into the cultural issues implicated in the structured knowledge transfer process, when a knowledge provider and a recipient are from different cultural dimensions, as well as offering more general insight into the mechanism of knowledge transfer in the cross-cultural business context.},

abstract = {We carried out metagenomic shotgun sequencing and a metagenome-wide association study (MGWAS) of fecal, dental and salivary samples from a cohort of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and healthy controls. Concordance was observed between the gut and oral microbiomes, suggesting overlap in the abundance and function of species at different body sites. Dysbiosis was detected in the gut and oral microbiomes of RA patients, but it was partially resolved after RA treatment. Alterations in the gut, dental or saliva microbiome distinguished individuals with RA from healthy controls, were correlated with clinical measures and could be used to stratify individuals on the basis of their response to therapy. In particular, Haemophilus spp. were depleted in individuals with RA at all three sites and negatively correlated with levels of serum autoantibodies, whereas Lactobacillus salivarius was over-represented in individuals with RA at all three sites and was present in increased amounts in cases of very active RA. Functionally, the redox environment, transport and metabolism of iron, sulfur, zinc and arginine were altered in the microbiota of individuals with RA. Molecular mimicry of human antigens related to RA was also detectable. Our results establish specific alterations in the gut and oral microbiomes in individuals with RA and suggest potential ways of using microbiome composition for prognosis and diagnosis.},

abstract = {Amazon's Mechanical Turk is an online labor market where requesters post jobs and workers choose which jobs to do for pay. The central purpose of this article is to demonstrate how to use this Web site for conducting behavioral research and to lower the barrier to entry for researchers who could benefit from this platform. We describe general techniques that apply to a variety of types of research and experiments across disciplines. We begin by discussing some of the advantages of doing experiments on Mechanical Turk, such as easy access to a large, stable, and diverse subject pool, the low cost of doing experiments, and faster iteration between developing theory and executing experiments. While other methods of conducting behavioral research may be comparable to or even better than Mechanical Turk on one or more of the axes outlined above, we will show that when taken as a whole Mechanical Turk can be a useful tool for many researchers. We will discuss how the behavior of workers compares with that of experts and laboratory subjects. Then we will illustrate the mechanics of putting a task on Mechanical Turk, including recruiting subjects, executing the task, and reviewing the work that was submitted. We also provide solutions to common problems that a researcher might face when executing their research on this platform, including techniques for conducting synchronous experiments, methods for ensuring high-quality work, how to keep data private, and how to maintain code security.},

abstract = {Scientists and neuroethicists have recently drawn attention to the ethical and regulatory issues surrounding the do-it-yourself (DIY) brain stimulation community, which comprises individuals stimulating their own brains with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for self-improvement. However, to date, existing regulatory proposals and ethical discussions have been put forth without engaging those involved in the DIY tDCS community or attempting to understand the nature of their practices. I argue that to better contend with the growing ethical and safety concerns surrounding DIY tDCS, we need to understand the practices of the community. This study presents the results of a preliminary inquiry into the DIY tDCS community, with a focus on knowledge that is formed, shared and appropriated within it. I show that when making or acquiring a device, DIYers (as some members call themselves) produce a body of knowledge that is completely separate from that of the scientific community, and share it via online forums, blogs, videos and personal communications. However, when applying tDCS, DIYers draw heavily on existing scientific knowledge, posting links to academic journal articles and scientific resources and adopting the standardised electrode placement system used by scientists. Some DIYers co-opt scientific knowledge and modify it by creating their own manuals and guides based on published papers. Finally, I explore how DIYers cope with the methodological limitations inherent in self-experimentation. I conclude by discussing how a deeper understanding of the practices of DIY tDCS has important regulatory and ethical implications.},

abstract = {Online learning is increasingly prevalent as an option for self-learning and as a resource for instructional design. Prerecorded video is currently the main medium of online education content delivery and instruction; this affords asynchronicity and flexibility, and enables the dissemination of lecture content in a distributed and scalable manner. However, the same properties may impede learners' engagement due to the lack of social interaction and peer support. In this paper, we propose a time-anchored commenting interface to allow online learners who watch the same video clips to exchange comments on them. Comments left by previous learners at specific time points of a video are displayed to new learners when they watch the same video and reach those time points. We investigated how the display of time-anchored comments (dynamic or static) and type of comments (content-related or social-oriented) influenced users' perceived engagement, perceived social interactivity, and learning outcomes. Our results show that dynamically displaying time-anchored comments can indeed enhance learners' perceived social interactivity. Moreover, the content of comments would further affect learners' intention of commenting. Based on our findings, we make various recommendations for the improvement of social interaction and learning experience in online education.},

abstract = {Supporting social interactions is a long-term focus for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer Supported CooperativeWork (CSCW). However, understanding how social and emotional skills are learned, and how this process can be supported by technology, is an important but underresearched area in HCI so far. To address this gap, we review existing approaches to social and emotions skills learning (SEL) in other fields, with a specific focus on SEL in education, in which a large number of evidence-based programs is widely deployed. In doing so, the primary aim of this article is to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology that would support, and help teach, social and emotional skills.We identify the key challenges to successful learning shared by SEL programs in education—such as embedding skills learned in class also into everyday situations, promoting reflection, and providing additional opportunities for practice—and outline how these could be addressed by digital technology. Overall, our key argument is that much existing HCI work could be used in support of social and emotional skills learning in education, and possibly other domains, but that the topic has not been explored so far. We also highlight how the focus on supporting SEL would bring novel opportunities and challenges forHCI, as well as provide a basis for a strong HCI research agenda in this space},

For example, images may be composed of several objects and sounds may consist of several notes. Latent feature models seek to infer these unobserved features from a set of observations; the IBP provides a principled prior in situations where the number of hidden features is unknown. Current inference methods for the IBP have all relied on sampling. While these methods are guaranteed to be accurate in the limit, samplers for the IBP tend to mix slowly in practice. We develop a deterministic variational method for inference in the IBP based on a truncated stick-breaking approximation, provide theoretical bounds on the truncation error, and evaluate our method in several data regimes.},

abstract = {Americans have long recognized that investments in public education contribute to the common good, enhancing national prosperity and supporting stable families, neighborhoods, and communities. Education is even more critical today, in the face of economic, environmental, and social challenges. Today's children can meet future challenges if their schooling and informal learning activities prepare them for adult roles as citizens, employees, managers, parents, volunteers, and entrepreneurs. To achieve their full potential as adults, young people need to develop a range of skills and knowledge that facilitate mastery and application of English, mathematics, and other school subjects. At the same time, business and political leaders are increasingly asking schools to develop skills such as problem solving, critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and self-management--often referred to as "21st century skills." "Education for Life and Work: Developing Transferable Knowledge and Skills in the 21st Century" describes this important set of key skills that increase deeper learning, college and career readiness, student-centered learning, and higher order thinking. These labels include both cognitive and non-cognitive skills--such as critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, effective communication, motivation, persistence, and learning to learn. 21st century skills also include creativity, innovation, and ethics that are important to later success and may be developed in formal or informal learning environments. This report also describes how these skills relate to each other and to more traditional academic skills and content in the key disciplines of reading, mathematics, and science. "Education for Life and Work: Developing Transferable Knowledge and Skills in the 21st Century" summarizes the findings of the research that investigates the importance of such skills to success in education, work, and other areas of adult responsibility and that demonstrates the importance of developing these skills in K-16 education. In this report, features related to learning these skills are identified, which include teacher professional development, curriculum, assessment, after-school and out-of-school programs, and informal learning centers such as exhibits and museums.},

abstract = {Online representational expansion techniques have improved the learning speed of existing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in low dimensional domains, yet existing online expansion methods do not scale well to high dimensional problems. We conjecture that one of the main difficulties limiting this scaling is that features defined over the full-dimensional state space often generalize poorly. Hence, we introduce incremental Feature Dependency Discovery (iFDD) as a computationally-inexpensive method for representational expansion that can be combined with any online, value-based RL method that uses binary features. Unlike other online expansion techniques, iFDD creates new features in low dimensional subspaces of the full state space where feedback errors persist. We provide convergence and computational complexity guarantees for iFDD, as well as showing empirically that iFDD scales well to high dimensional multi-agent planning domains with hundreds of millions of state-action pairs.},

abstract = {The Genographic Project is an international effort aimed at charting human migratory history. The project is nonprofit and nonmedical, and, through its Legacy Fund, supports locally led efforts to preserve indigenous and traditional cultures. Although the first phase of the project was focused on uniparentally inherited markers on the Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the current phase focuses on markers from across the entire genome to obtain a more complete understanding of human genetic variation. Although many commercial arrays exist for genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, they were designed for medical genetic studies and contain medically related markers that are inappropriate for global population genetic studies. GenoChip, the Genographic Project's new genotyping array, was designed to resolve these issues and enable higher resolution research into outstanding questions in genetic anthropology. The GenoChip includes ancestry informative markers obtained for over 450 human populations, an ancient human (Saqqaq), and two archaic hominins (Neanderthal and Denisovan) and was designed to identify all known Y-chromosome and mtDNA haplogroups. The chip was carefully vetted to avoid inclusion of medically relevant markers. To demonstrate its capabilities, we compared the FST distributions of GenoChip SNPs to those of two commercial arrays. Although all arrays yielded similarly shaped (inverse J) FST distributions, the GenoChip autosomal and X-chromosomal distributions had the highest mean FST, attesting to its ability to discern subpopulations. The chip performances are illustrated in a principal component analysis for 14 worldwide populations. In summary, the GenoChip is a dedicated genotyping platform for genetic anthropology. With an unprecedented number of approximately 12,000 Y-chromosomal and approximately 3,300 mtDNA SNPs and over 130,000 autosomal and X-chromosomal SNPs without any known health, medical, or phenotypic relevance, the GenoChip is a useful tool for genetic anthropology and population genetics.},

Reflective learning means returning to and evaluating past experiences in order to promote continuous learning and improve future experiences. Whilst the reflective learning theories do not sufficiently consider technical support, Quantified Self (QS) approaches are rather experimental and the many emergent tools are disconnected from the goals and benefits of their use. This paper brings these two strands into one unified framework that shows how QS approaches can support reflective learning processes on the one hand and how reflective learning can inform the design of new QS tools for informal learning purposes on the other hand.},

These devices automatically capture human behavior (such as walking) but do not typically make the user aware detected unhealthy behaviors . Furthermore, these devices cannot intervene in the moment to make users aware they are engaging in unhealthy behavior (such as sitting for a long period of time) and persuade them to correct these unhealthy behaviors (e.g., by taking a break to go for a walk). There is an increasing trend for people with low physical activity occupations to sit for long periods of time, yet research suggests that lengthy sitting, independent of overall physical activity level, increases the risk of weight gain and mortality [1]. We aim to decrease the duration of sedentary bouts in the workplace by detecting when people have been inactive for a long time and then prompting them take a short break from their desks. In this poster we present the design of Fitbit+, a system that realizes this strategy by leveraging Fitbit's near real-time, automated step logging to detect sedentary behavior and then prompt users to take short breaks. {\textcopyright} 2012 ICST.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Evolving research practices and new forms of research enabled by technological advances require a redesigned research oversight system that respects and protects human research participants. OBJECTIVE Our objective was to generate creative ideas for redesigning our current human research oversight system. METHODS A total of 11 researchers and institutional review board (IRB) professionals participated in a January 2015 design thinking workshop to develop ideas for redesigning the IRB system. RESULTS Ideas in 5 major domains were generated. The areas of focus were (1) improving the consent form and process, (2) empowering researchers to protect their participants, (3) creating a system to learn from mistakes, (4) improving IRB efficiency, and (5) facilitating review of research that leverages technological advances. CONCLUSIONS We describe the impetus for and results of a design thinking workshop to reimagine a human research protections system that is responsive to 21st century science.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of an African American Y chromosome that carries the ancestral state of all SNPs that defined the basal portion of the Y chromosome phylogenetic tree. We sequenced ???240 kb of this chromosome to identify private, derived mutations on this lineage, which we named A00. We then estimated the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for the Y tree as 338 thousand years ago (kya) (95{\%} confidence interval = 237-581 kya). Remarkably, this exceeds current estimates of the mtDNA TMRCA, as well as those of the age of the oldest anatomically modern human fossils. The extremely ancient age combined with the rarity of the A00 lineage, which we also find at very low frequency in central Africa, point to the importance of considering more complex models for the origin of Y chromosome diversity. These models include ancient population structure and the possibility of archaic introgression of Y chromosomes into anatomically modern humans. The A00 lineage was discovered in a large database of consumer samples of African Americans and has not been identified in traditional hunter-gatherer populations from sub-Saharan Africa. This underscores how the stochastic nature of the genealogical process can affect inference from a single locus and warrants caution during the interpretation of the geographic location of divergent branches of the Y chromosome phylogenetic tree for the elucidation of human origins. ?? 2013 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

This is exemplified by the profitable business of genetic ancestry testing. The goals of this sort of 'big science' are not necessarily in any way novel, however. In particular, large genotyping projects have a certain start-up time when their design is frozen in, so that the projects often lag behind the development of genetic knowledge. On the other hand, extremely provisional knowledge about potential disease markers is being rapidly turned into questionable 'tests', purporting to determine risk factors for complex disorders, by private companies that are eager to get their share of a profitable market of the future. The flow of money generated by such concerns looks likely to erode traditional research operations and small-scale projects, which risk becoming pebbles on the 'big science' landscape.},

We begin with an exploration of how digital technologies have transformed$\backslash$neveryday learning and entertainment practices, and though classrooms have been relatively$\backslash$nunaffected by these new technologies; school management practices have been completely$\backslash$ntransformed by data technologies. We propose that these two levels of reform provide the basis$\backslash$nfor an illustrative contrast between technologies for education and technologies for learners. The$\backslash$ndifferences in adoption are not, we argue, a result of kinds of technology at play. Rather, we$\backslash$nsuggest that the patterns of adoption result from differing cultures of use: schools adapt$\backslash$ntechnologies in accountability cultures, and learners adapt technologies in participatory cultures.$\backslash$nOrganizational theorists have long observed how institutions adapt innovations to uses that are$\backslash$nconsistent with existing cultures and practices (Argyris {\&} Sch{\"{o}}n, 1996). The same kinds of$\backslash$ntechnologies can support a wide range of practices depending on how users frame the problems$\backslash$nthat need to be solved (Orlikowski, 2000). Our contrast between technologies for education and$\backslash$nfor learners is intended to highlight the how the cultures of use in schools and in the world$\backslash$nexplain the ways that technologies have, and have not, flourished in schools, and point toward$\backslash$nproductive opportunities for schools to embrace the power of new technologies.},

However, people struggle with impression management, and with reaching the right audiences when they share health information on these platforms. Instagram, a popular photo-based social media platform, has attracted many people who post and share their food photos. We aim to inform the design of tools to support healthy behaviors by understanding how people appropriate Instagram to track and share food data, the benefits they obtain from doing so, and the challenges they encounter. We interviewed 16 women who consistently record and share what they eat on Instagram. Participants tracked to support themselves and others in their pursuit of healthy eating goals. They sought social support for their own tracking and healthy behaviors and strove to provide that support for others. People adapted their personal tracking practices to better receive and give this support. Applying these results to the design of health tracking tools has the potential to help people better access social support.},

This article argues that this assumption inevitably limits the effectiveness of such practices. Drawing on recent research into cognition as it is manifest in everyday activity, the authors argue that knowledge is situated, being in part a product of the activity, context, and culture in which it is developed and used. They discuss how this view of knowledge affects our understanding of learning, and they note that conventional schooling too often ignores the influence of school culture on what is learned in school. As an alternative to conventional practices, they propose cognitive apprenticeship (Collins, Brown, {\&} Newman, in press), which honors the situated nature of knowledge. They examine two examples of mathematics instruction that exhibit certain key features of this approach to teaching.},

However, data from field experiments can also be used to inform new lab experiments. Now, with the advent of large student populations using internet- based learning software, online experiments can serve as a third setting for experimental data collection. In this paper, we introduce the Super Experiment Framework (SEF), which describes how internet-scale experiments can inform and be informed by classroom and lab experiments. We apply the framework to a research project implementing learning games for mathematics that is collecting hundreds of thousands of data trials weekly. We show that the framework allows findings from the lab-scale, classroom-scale and internet-scale experiments to inform each other in a rapid complementary feedback loop.},

In each case, guided discovery was more effective than pure dis- covery in helping students learn and transfer. Overall, the constructivist view of learning may be best supported by methods of instruction that involve cognitive activity rather than behavioral activity, instructional guidance rather than pure discovery, and curricular focus rather than unstructured exploration.},

Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems towards a desired state, a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system's entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.},

In remote and inhospitable locations, observation can be an arduous, expensive, and dangerous experience for field scientists. We are developing a new class of networked teleoperated robotic “observatories„ that allows “citizen scientists„ and professional scientists to remotely observe, record, and index animal activity and behaviors via the internet. This paper describes CONE-Welder, installed at the Rob {\&} Bessie Welder Wildlife Foundation in Texas to gather photographic and quantitative data for a biological study of avian activity and hypothesized range change for selected subtropical bird species. Since the system was deployed on 12 May 2008, over 600 users (“players„) have participated online. Players have requested over 2.2 million camera frames and captured over 29,000 photographs. Within these photos, citizen scientists have classified 74 unique species, including eight avian species previously unknown to have breeding populations within the region. The collected dataset quantifies seasonal presence of birds of particular interest, e.g., the Green Jay (Cyanocorax incas). This paper describes the system architecture, the game interface that provides incentives for player participation, and initial data collected.

abstract = {Studies of the human microbiome have revealed that even healthy individuals differ remarkably in the microbes that occupy habitats such as the gut, skin, and vagina. Much of this diversity remains unexplained, although diet, environment, host genetics, and early microbial exposure have all been implicated. Accordingly, to characterize the ecology of human-associated microbial communities, the Human Microbiome Project has analyzed the largest cohort and set of distinct, clinically relevant body habitats to date. We found the diversity and abundance of each habitat's signature microbes to vary widely even among healthy subjects, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals. The project encountered an estimated 81–99{\%} of the genera, enzyme families, and community configurations occupied by the healthy Western microbiome. Metagenomic carriage of metabolic pathways was stable among individuals despite variation in community structure, and ethnic/racial background proved to be one of the strongest associationa of both pathways and microbes with clinical metadata. These results thus delineate the range of structural and functional configurations normal in the microbial communities of a healthy population, enabling future characterization of the epidemiology, ecology, and translational applications of the human microbiome.},

abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) aim to educate the world. More often than not, however, MOOCs fall short of this goal — a majority of learners are already highly educated (with a Bachelor degree or more) and come from specific parts of the (developed) world. Learners from developing countries without a higher degree are underrepresented, though desired, in MOOCs. One reason for those learners to drop out of a course can be found in their financial realities and the subsequent limited amount of time they can dedicate to a course besides earning a living. If we could pay learners to take a MOOC, this hurdle would largely disappear. With MOOCS, this leads to the following fundamental challenge: How can learners be paid at scale? Ultimately, we envision a recommendation engine that recommends tasks from online market places such as Upwork or witmart to learners, that are relevant to the course content of the MOOC. In this manner, the learners learn and earn money. To investigate the feasibility of this vision, in this paper we explored to what extent (1) online market places contain tasks relevant to a specific MOOC, and (2) learners are able to solve real-world tasks correctly and with sufficient quality. Finally, based on our experimental design, we were also able to investigate the impact of real-world bonus tasks in a MOOC on the general learner population.},

To examine how gut microbiomes differ among human populations, here we characterize bacterial species in fecal samples from 531 individuals, plus the gene content of 110 of them. The cohort encompassed healthy children and adults from the Amazonas of Venezuela, rural Malawi and US metropolitan areas and included mono- and dizygotic twins. Shared features of the functional maturation of the gut microbiome were identified during the first three years of life in all three populations, including age-associated changes in the genes involved in vitamin biosynthesis and metabolism. Pronounced differences in bacterial assemblages and functional gene repertoires were noted between US residents and those in the other two countries. These distinctive features are evident in early infancy as well as adulthood. Our findings underscore the need to consider the microbiome when evaluating human development, nutritional needs, physiological variations and the impact of westernization.},

abstract = {Online learning is increasingly prevalent as an option for self-learning and as a resource for instructional design. Prerecorded video is currently the main medium of online education content delivery and instruction; this affords asynchronicity and flexibility, and enables the dissemination of lecture content in a distributed and scalable manner. However, the same properties may impede learners' engagement due to the lack of social interaction and peer support. In this paper, we propose a time-anchored commenting interface to allow online learners who watch the same video clips to exchange comments on them. Comments left by previous learners at specific time points of a video are displayed to new learners when they watch the same video and reach those time points. We investigated how the display of time-anchored comments (dynamic or static) and type of comments (content-related or social-oriented) influenced users' perceived engagement, perceived social interactivity, and learning outcomes. Our results show that dynamically displaying time-anchored comments can indeed enhance learners' perceived social interactivity. Moreover, the content of comments would further affect learners' intention of commenting. Based on our findings, we make various recommendations for the improvement of social interaction and learning experience in online education.},

These improvements are intended to help students learn more from pre-class reading and to increase student engagement in the discussion sections, and are accompanied by further increases in student understanding.},

abstract = {The research reported in this paper focuses on the hypothesis that an intelligent tutoring system that provides guidance with respect to students' meta-cognitive abilities can help them to become better learners. Our strategy is to extend a Cognitive Tutor (Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger, {\&} Pelletier, 1995) so that it not only helps students acquire domain-specific skills, but also develop better general help-seeking strategies. In developing the Help Tutor, we used the same Cognitive Tutor technology at the meta- cognitive level that has been proven to be very effective at the cognitive level. A key challenge is to develop a model of how students should use a Cognitive Tutor's help facilities. We created a preliminary model, implemented by 57 production rules that capture both effective and ineffective help-seeking behavior. As a first test of the model's efficacy, we used it off-line to evaluate students' help-seeking behavior in an existing data set of student-tutor interactions. We then refined the model based on the results of this analysis. Finally, we conducted a pilot study with the Help Tutor involving four students. During one session, we saw a statistically significant reduction in students' meta-cognitive error rate, as determined by the Help Tutor's model. These preliminary results inspire confidence as we gear up for a larger-scale controlled experiment to evaluate whether tutoring on help seeking has a positive effect on students' learning outcomes.},

This paper describes CONE-Welder, installed at the Rob {\&} Bessie Welder Wildlife Foundation in Texas to gather photographic and quantitative data for a biological study of avian activity and hypothesized range change for selected subtropical bird species. Since the system was deployed on 12 May 2008, over 600 users (“players”) have participated online. Players have requested over 2.2 million camera frames and captured over 29,000 photographs. Within these photos, citizen scientists have classified 74 unique species, including eight avian species previously unknown to have breeding populations within the region. The collected dataset quantifies seasonal presence of birds of particular interest, e.g., the Green Jay (Cyanocorax incas). This paper describes the system architecture, the game interface that provides incentives for player participation, and initial data collected. CONE-Welder is available online at:},

abstract = {When students work with peers, they learn more actively, build richer knowledge structures, and connect material to their lives. However, not every peer learning experience online sees successful adoption. This paper articulates and addresses three adoption challenges for global-scale peer learning. First, peer interactions struggle to bootstrap critical mass. However, class incentives can signal importance and spur initial usage. Second, online classes have limited peer visibility and awareness, so students often feel alone even when surrounded by peers. We find that highlighting interdependence and strengthening norms can mitigate this issue. Third, teachers can readily access "big" aggregate data but not "thick" contextual data that helps build intuitions, so software should guide teachers' scaffolding of peer interactions. We illustrate these challenges through studying 8,500 students' usage of two peer learning platforms, Talkabout and PeerStudio. This paper measures efficacy through sign-up and participation rates and the structure and duration of student interactions.},

Based on in-depth interviews about home heating and thermostat setting behavior, the present study presents two theories people use to understand and adjust their thermostats. The two theories are here called the feedback theory and the valve theory. The valve theory is inconsistent with engineering knowledge, but is estimated to be held by 25{\%} to 50{\%} of Americans. Predictions of each of the theories are compared with the operations normally performed in home heat control. This comparison suggests that the valve theory may be highly functional in normal day-to-day use. Further data is needed on the ways this theory guides behavior in natural environments. ?? 1986 Cognitive Science Society.},

Two groups of 4 students in 2 different classes in 11th grade (15?16 years old) are followed as they process results and experiences from a lab experiment using a digital environment. The experiment is as a part of a larger project about genes and cells, and this study concerns how the digital environment can support students' sensemaking. The study shows how the students only are left with ?how-to' skills before they engage in collaborative processing supported by their own picture from the experiment. The picture becomes a hub for interactive sensemaking and is extensively used for annotation and discussion. Four elements in the digital support are identified as crucial: an extendable point of reference, facilitation to compare and contrast, a pointer to standard science knowledge, and a structure to guide the students to significant issues. The study identifies where the digital support succeeds and fails in this process of sensemaking from a lab experiment.},

abstract = {A method of organizing the crowd to generate ideas is described. It integrates crowds using evolutionary algorithms. The method increases the creativity of ideas across generations, and it works better than greenfield idea generation. Specifically, a design space of internet-scale idea generation systems is defined, and one instance is tested: a crowd idea generation system that uses combination to improve previous designs. The key process of the system is the following: A crowd generates designs, then another crowd combines the designs of the previous crowd. In an experiment with 540 participants, the combined designs were compared to the initial designs and to the designs produced by a greenfield idea generation system. The results show that the sequential combination system produced more creative ideas in the last generation and outperformed the greenfield idea generation system. The design space of crowdsourced idea generation developed here may be used to instantiate systems that can be applied to a wide range of design problems. The work has both pragmatic and theoretical implications: New forms of coordination are now possible, and, using the crowd, it is possible to test existing and emerging theories of coordination and participatory design. Moreover, it may be possible for human designers, organized as a crowd, to codesign with each other and with automated algorithms. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

We theorize and present experimental evidence linking intermediate versus final disclosure to an 'incentives-versus-reuse' tradeoff and to a transformation of the innovation search process. We find intermediate disclosure has the advantage of efficiently steering development towards improving existing solution approaches, but also has the effect of limiting experimentation and narrowing technological search.

We show how this turn detector can find dominance in video-based conversations.

Specifically, participants in a crowdsourcing marketplace sketched chairs for children. One crowd created a first generation of chairs, and then successive crowds created new generations by combining the chairs made by previous crowds. Other participants evaluated the chairs. The crowd judged the chairs from the third generation more creative than those from the first generation. An analysis of the design evolution shows that participants inherited and modified presented features, and also added new features. These findings suggest that crowd based design processes may be effective, and point the way toward computer-human interactions that might further encourage crowd creativity.},

In this article, we first provide an overview of distributed innovation systems that are achieving success in three different industries with three different organizational models.We then consider in the context of these three examples questions and concerns related to why people participate, the organizing principles of production, and the implications for intellectual property.

We examine research related to collective intelligence and differentiate work on collective creativity from other collective activities by analyzing systems with respect to the tasks that are performed and the outputs that result. Three types of systems are discussed: games, contests and networks. We conclude by suggesting how systems that generate collective creativity can be improved and how new systems might be constructed.},

@article{Kornish2011,
abstract = {A common approach to innovation, parallel search, is to identify a large number of opportunities and then to select a subset for further development, with just a few coming to fruition. One potential weakness with parallel search is that it permits repetition. The same, or a similar, idea might be generated multiple times, because parallel exploration processes typically operate without information about the ideas that have already been identified. In this paper we analyze repetition in five data sets comprising 1,368 opportunities and use that analysis to address three questions: (1) When a large number of efforts to generate ideas are conducted in parallel, how likely are the resulting ideas to be redundant? (2) How large are the opportunity spaces? (3) Are the unique ideas more valuable than those similar to many others? The answer to the first question is that although there is clearly some redundancy in the ideas generated by aggregating parallel efforts, this redundancy is quite small in absolute terms in our data, even for a narrowly defined domain. For the second question, we propose a method to extrapolate how many unique ideas would result from an unbounded effort by an unlimited number of comparable idea generators. Applying that method, and for the settings we study, the estimated total number of unique ideas is about one thousand for the most narrowly defined domain and greater than two thousand for the more broadly defined domains. On the third question, we find a positive relationship between the number of similar ideas and idea value: the ideas that are least similar to others are not generally the most valuable ones.},

abstract = {Classic ways of gathering data on human behaviour are time-consuming, costly and are subject to limited participant pools. Crowdsourcing offers a reduction in operating costs and access to a diverse and large participant pool; however issues arise concerning low worker pay and questions about data quality. Gamification provides a motivation to participate, but also requires the development of specialized, research-question specific games that can be costly to produce. Our solution combines gamification and crowdsourcing in a smartphone-based system that emulates the popular Freemium model of play to motivate voluntary participation through in-game rewards, using a robust framework to study multiple unrelated research questions within the same system. We deployed our game on the Android store and compared it to a gamified laboratory version and a non-gamified laboratory version, and found that players who used the in-game rewards were motivated to do experimental tasks. There was no difference between the systems for performance on a motor task; however, performance on the cognitive task was worse for the crowdsourced game. We discuss options for improving performance on tasks requiring attention.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing systems, in which tasks are electronically distributed to numerous “information piece-workers”, have emerged as an effective paradigm for humanpowered solving of large scale problems in domains such as image classification, data entry, optical character recognition, recommendation, and proofreading. Because these low-paid workers can be unreliable, nearly all crowdsourcers must devise schemes to increase confidence in their answers, typically by assigning each task multiple times and combining the answers in some way such as majority voting. In this paper, we consider a general model of such crowdsourcing tasks, and pose the problem of minimizing the total price (i.e., number of task assignments) that must be paid to achieve a target overall reliability. We give a new algorithm for deciding which tasks to assign to which workers and for inferring correct answers from the workers' answers. We show that our algorithm significantly outperforms majority voting and, in fact, is asymptotically optimal through comparison to an oracle that knows the reliability of every worker.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing systems often have crowd workers that perform unreliable work on the task they are assigned. In this paper, we propose the use of error-control codes and decoding algorithms to design crowdsourcing systems for reliable classification despite unreliable crowd workers. Coding theory based techniques also allow us to pose easy-to-answer binary questions to the crowd workers. We consider three different crowdsourcing models: systems with independent crowd workers, systems with peer-dependent reward schemes, and systems where workers have common sources of information. For each of these models, we analyze classification performance with the proposed coding-based scheme. We develop an ordering principle for the quality of crowds and describe how system performance changes with the quality of the crowd. We also show that pairing among workers and diversification of the questions help in improving system performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed coding-based scheme using both simulated data and real datasets from Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing microtask platform. Results suggest that use of good codes may improve the performance of the crowdsourcing task over typical majority-voting approaches. {\textcopyright} 2007-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Many information systems have failed when deployed into complex health-care settings. We believe that one cause of these failures is the difficulty in systematically accounting for the collaborative and exception-filled nature of medical work. In this methodological review paper, we highlight research from the field of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) that could help biomedical informaticists recognize and design around the kinds of challenges that lead to unanticipated breakdowns and eventual abandonment of their systems. The field of CSCW studies how people collaborate with each other and the role that technology plays in this collaboration for a wide variety of organizational settings. Thus, biomedical informaticists could benefit from the lessons learned by CSCW researchers. In this paper, we provide a focused review of CSCW methods and ideas - we review aspects of the field that could be applied to improve the design and deployment of medical information systems. To make our discussion concrete, we use electronic medical record systems as an example medical information system, and present three specific principles from CSCW: accounting for incentive structures, understanding workflow, and incorporating awareness. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

We present an analysis of these projects in three different dimensions. Initially, we look at the types of blocks used and the size of the projects. We then inves-tigate complexity, used abstractions and programming con-cepts. Finally we detect code smells like large scripts, dead code and duplicated code blocks. Our results show that 1) most Scratch programs are small, however Scratch programs consisting of over 100 sprites exist, 2) programming abstrac-tion concepts like procedures are not commonly used and 3) Scratch programs do suffer from code smells including large scripts and unmatched broadcast signals.},

abstract = {Over almost three decades, the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) has produced a rich and varied literature. Although the focus of attention today is naturally on new work, older contributions that played a role in shaping the trajectory and character of the field have much to tell us. The contributors to HCI Remixed were asked to reflect on a single work at least ten years old that influenced their approach to HCI. The result is this collection of fifty-one short, engaging, and idiosyncratic essays, reflections on a range of works in a variety of forms that chart the emergence of a new field. An article, a demo, a book: any of these can solve a problem, demonstrate the usefulness of a new method, or prompt a shift in perspective. HCI Remixed offers us glimpses of how this comes about. The contributors consider such HCI classics as Sutherland's Sketchpad, Englebart's demo of NLS, and Fitts on Fitts' Lawand such forgotten gems as Pulfer's NRC Music Machine, and Galloway and Rabinowitz's Hole in Space. Others reflect on works somewhere in between classic and forgottenKidd's "The Marks Are on the Knowledge Worker," King Beach's "Becoming a Bartender," and others. Some contributors turn to works in neighboring disciplinesHenry Dreyfuss's book on industrial design, for exampleand some range farther afield, to Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis and Jane Jacobs's The Death and Life of Great American Cities. Taken together, the essays offer an accessible, lively, and engaging introduction to HCI research that reflects the diversity of the field's beginnings.},

We discuss a set of lessons learned for other similar Big Data systems. In particular, we argue that at large scales crowdsourcing is critical, but must be used in combination with learning, rules, and in-house analysts. We also argue that using rules (in conjunction with learning) is a must, and that more re-search attention should be paid to helping analysts create and manage (tens of thousands of) rules more effectively.},

Requesters can hire peer workers to review others' work, but the value may be marginal, especially if the reviewers lack requisite knowledge. Our research explores if and how workers learn and improve their performance in a task domain by serving as peer reviewers. Further, we investigate whether peer reviewing may be more effective in teams where the reviewers can reach consensus through discussion. An online between-subjects experiment compares the tradeoffs of reviewing versus producing work using three different organization strategies: working individually, working as an interactive team, and aggregating individuals into nominal groups. The results show that workers who review others' work perform better on subsequent tasks than workers who just produce. We also find that interactive reviewer teams outperform individual reviewers on all quality measures. However, aggregating individual reviewers into nominal groups produces better quality assessments than interactive teams, except in task domains where discussion helps overcome individual misconceptions.

abstract = {Crowd work provides solutions to complex problems effectively, efficiently, and at low cost. Previous research showed that feedback, particularly correctness feedback can help crowd workers improve their performance; yet such feedback, particularly when generated by experts, is costly and difficult to scale. In our research we investigate approaches to facilitating continuous observational learning in crowdsourcing communities. In a study conducted with workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we asked workers to complete a set of tasks identifying nutritional composition of different meals. We examined workers' accuracy gains after being exposed to expert-generated feedback and to two types of peer-generated feedback: direct accuracy assessment with explanations of errors, and a comparison with solutions generated by other workers. The study further confirmed that expert-generated feedback is a powerful mechanism for facilitating learning and leads to significant gains in accuracy. However, the study also showed that comparing one's own solutions with a variety of solutions suggested by others and their comparative frequencies leads to significant gains in accuracy. This solution is particularly attractive because of its low cost, minimal impact on time and cost of job completion, and high potential for adoption by a variety of crowdsourcing platforms.},

abstract = {The way a company views its markets determines what it decides to produce, how it will take those products to market, who it believes its competitors to be, and how large it believes its market opportunities to be. Most companies segment along lines defined by the characteristics of their products (category or price) or customers (age, gender, marital status and income level) because that is the most easily accessible type of data, but product and customer characteristics are poor indicators of customer behavior because that is not how markets are structured from the customers perspective. Customers simply need to get things done, whether that be fixing their car, staving off boredom, or finding something fun to do with their kids. These situational needs for which customers are looking to hire products or services go unnoticed during traditional market research and segmentation. As a result, the true breadth of competition often goes unnoticed too. When companies understand what they are up against in the mind of the customer, they can piece together the real size of the market in which they compete. Using examples from the fast food industry, furniture retailing, the automobile industry and health care, and citing a wide variety of companies and brands, including FedEx, Starbucks, Google, Blackberry, TurboTax and OnStar, this article describes the benefits that executives can reap when they segment their markets by job (the risk and cost of innovation is minimized), the methods that those involved in marketing and new-product development can use to identify the job-based structure of a market (interviews, surveys, observation, empathic and co-evolution techniques), and how the details of business plans can be made more coherent and focused when innovators understand the job to be done.

Despite positive anecdotal reports, there is currently little empirical evidence to support their efficacy in particular domains. With the recent rapid growth of tools for online learning, an interesting open ques- tion for educators is the extent to which badges can positively impact student participation.$\backslash$nIn this paper, we report on a large-scale (n {\textgreater} 1000) random- ized, controlled experiment measuring the impact of incor- porating a badge-based achievement system within an online learning tool. We discover a highly significant positive effect on the quantity of students' contributions, without a corre- sponding reduction in their quality, as well as on the period of time over which students engaged with the tool. Students enjoyed being able to earn badges, and indicated a strong pref- erence for having them available in the user interface.},

abstract = {This research investigates how to introduce synchronous interactive peer learning into an online setting appropriate both for crowdworkers (learning new tasks) and students in massive online courses (learning course material). We present an interaction framework in which groups of learners are formed on demand and then proceed through a sequence of activities that include synchronous group discussion about learnergenerated responses. Via controlled experiments with crowdworkers, we show that discussing challenging problems leads to better outcomes than working individually, and incentivizing people to help one another yields still better results. We then show that providing a mini-lesson in which workers consider the principles underlying the tested concept and justify their answers leads to further improvements. Combining the mini-lesson with the discussion of the multiple-choice question leads to significant improvements on that question. We also find positive subjective responses to the peer interactions, suggesting that discussions can improve morale in remote work or learning settings.},

This study develops a deeper understanding of the circumstances under which crowdsourcing is a useful, feasible or desirable tool for research, as well as the factors that may influence researchers' decisions around adopting crowdsourcing technology. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 researchers in diverse disciplines, spanning the humanities and sciences, to illuminate how research norms and practitioners' dispositions were related to uncertainties around research processes, data, knowledge, delegation and quality.

MOOCs have been used mostly as stand-alone, online courses without credits. However, some researchers, teachers, colleges, and universities have attempted to utilize MOOCs in blended format in traditional classroom settings. This paper reviews some recent experiments in the context of current trends in MOOCs by examining methodologies utilized in blended MOOCs in a face-to-face environment. This paper further discusses the preliminary findings related to its effectiveness of learning outcomes and its impact on students and instructors in blended MOOCs format. The review of blended MOOCs in classrooms assists to form the emerging consensus on integrating MOOCs in conventional classroom settings, while highlighting potential opportunities and challenges one might face when implementing MOOCs in similar or entirely different contexts.},

Introduction of a new feature into the computer game Foldit allows players to build and real-space refine structures into electron density maps. To assess the usefulness of this feature, we held a crystallographic model-building competition between trained crystallographers, undergraduate students, Foldit players and automatic model-building algorithms. After removal of disordered residues, a team of Foldit players achieved the most accurate structure. Analysing the target protein of the competition, YPL067C, uncovered a new family of histidine triad proteins apparently involved in the prevention of amyloid toxicity. From this study, we conclude that crystallographers can utilize crowdsourcing to interpret electron density information and to produce structure solutions of the highest quality.},

Conformity was observed in all three experiments; participants tended to incorporate critical features of experimenter-provided examples. However, examination of total output, elaborateness of design, and the noncritical features did not confirm that the conformity effect constrained creative output in any of the three experiments. Increasing the number of examples increased the conformity effect (Ex-periment 1). Examples that covaried features that are naturally uncorrelated in the real world led to a greater subjective rating of creativity (Experiment 2). A delay between presentation and test increased conformity (Experiment 3), just as models of inadvertent plagiarism would predict. The explanatory power of theoretical accounts such as activation, retrieval blocking, structured imagination, and cate-gory abstraction are evaluated.},

abstract = {The relationship between students' use of PeerWise, an online tool that facilitates peer learning through student-generated content in the form of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and achievement, as measured by their performance in the end-of-module examinations, was investigated in 5 large early-years science modules (in physics, chemistry and biology) across 3 research-intensive UK universities. A complex pattern was observed in terms of which type of activity (writing, answering or commenting on questions) was most beneficial for students; however, there was some evidence that students of lower intermediate ability may have gained particular benefit. In all modules, a modest but statistically significant positive correlation was found between students' PeerWise activity and their examination performance, after taking prior ability into account. This suggests that engaging with the production and discussion of student-generated content in the form of MCQs can support student learning in a way that is not critically dependent on course, institution, instructor or student.

@article{Jain2013,
abstract = {We study the problem of computing conditional probabilities, a fundamental operation in statistics and machine learning. In the elementary discrete setting, a ratio of probabilities defines conditional probability. In the abstract setting, conditional probability is defined axiomatically and the search for more constructive definitions is the subject of a rich literature in probability theory and statistics. In the discrete or dominated setting, under suitable computability hypotheses, conditional probabilities are computable. However, we show that in general one cannot compute conditional probabilities. We do this by constructing a pair of computable random variables in the unit interval whose conditional distribution encodes the halting problem at almost every point. We show that this result is tight, in the sense that given an oracle for the halting problem, one can compute this conditional distribution. On the other hand, we show that conditioning in abstract settings is computable in the presence of certain additional structure, such as independent absolutely continuous noise.},

abstract = {We show here that computer game players can build high-quality crystal structures. Introduction of a new feature into the computer game Foldit allows players to build and real-space refine structures into electron density maps. To assess the usefulness of this feature, we held a crystallographic model-building competition between trained crystallographers, undergraduate students, Foldit players and automatic model-building algorithms. After removal of disordered residues, a team of Foldit players achieved the most accurate structure. Analysing the target protein of the competition, YPL067C, uncovered a new family of histidine triad proteins apparently involved in the prevention of amyloid toxicity. From this study, we conclude that crystallographers can utilize crowdsourcing to interpret electron density information and to produce structure solutions of the highest quality.},

Creating exam questions is normally the responsibility of the course instructor, however the process of authoring such questions may be a useful learning activity in itself. We explored this idea with a randomized controlled experiment (n {\textgreater} 700) in which a group of first-year programming students generated practice questions prior to an exam. Even though all questions were available to every student in the course for practice, the group that generated the questions performed significantly better on the exam. The effects were most pronounced when students answered exam questions on topics that were targeted by questions they had generated. We suggest that some existing tools for computer science education may benefit from incorporating related activities.},

abstract = {To understand developers' typical tools, activities, and practices and their satisfaction with each, we conducted two surveys and eleven interviews. We found that many problems arose because developers were forced to invest great effort recovering implicit knowledge by exploring code and interrupting teammates and this knowledge was only saved in their memory. Contrary to expectations that email and IM prevent expensive task switches caused by face-to-face interruptions, we found that face-to-face communication enjoys many advantages. Contrary to expectations that documentation makes understanding design rationale easy, we found that current design documents are inadequate. Contrary to expectations that code duplication involves the copy and paste of code snippets, developers reported several types of duplication. We use data to characterize these and other problems and draw implications for the design of tools for their solution.},

abstract = {The "doer effect" is an association between the number of online interactive practice activities students' do and their learning outcomes that is not only statistically reliable but has much higher positive effects than other learning resources, such as watching videos or reading text. Such an association suggests a causal interpretation--more doing yields better learning--which requires randomized experimentation to most rigorously confirm. But such experiments are expensive, and any single experiment in a particular course context does not provide rigorous evidence that the causal link will generalize to other course content. We suggest that analytics of increasingly available online learning data sets can complement experimental efforts by facilitating more widespread evaluation of the generalizability of claims about what learning methods produce better student learning outcomes. We illustrate with analytics that narrow in on a causal interpretation of the doer effect by showing that doing within a course unit predicts learning of that unit content more than doing in units before or after. We also provide generalizability evidence across four different courses involving over 12,500 students that the learning effect of doing is about six times greater than that of reading.},

abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have gained tremendous popularity in the last few years. Thanks to MOOCs, millions of learners from all over the world have taken thousands of high-quality courses for free. Putting together an excellent MOOC ecosystem is a multidisciplinary endeavour that requires contributions from many different fields. Artificial intelligence (AI) and data mining (DM) are two such fields that have played a significant role in making MOOCs what they are today. By exploiting the vast amount of data generated by learners engaging in MOOCs, DM improves our understanding of the MOOC ecosystem and enables MOOC practitioners to deliver better courses. Similarly, AI, supported by DM, can greatly improve student experience and learning outcomes. In this survey paper, we first review the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and data mining research applied to MOOCs, emphasising the use of AI and DM tools and techniques to improve student engagement, learning outcomes, and our understanding of the MOOC ecosystem. We then offer an overview of key trends and important research to carry out in the fields of AI and DM so that MOOCs can reach their full potential.},

abstract = {Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have developed rapidly and become tremendously popular because of their plentiful gamification designs, such as reputation points, rewards, and goal setting. Although previous studies have mentioned a broad range of gamification designs that might influence MOOC learner engagement, most gamified MOOCs fail to meet learning objectives because of a lack of research regarding suitable game design, as well as poor rationale for or design of gamification mechanics. This study aims to explore and identify engaging gamification mechanics for MOOC learners. We conducted a focus group interview with 25 MOOC frequent users to identify 40 gamification mechanics. This study then determined the relative engagingness of these gamification mechanics by administering an online survey to 5,020 MOOC learners. The results indicated that the 10 most engaging gamification mechanics accounted for more than 50{\%} of the engagingness. The mechanics of the Where's Wally game is extremely engaging for MOOC learners; however, they it is not been demonstrated in previous relevant studies. Finally, we discuss the top five engaging gamification mechanics and their implications.},

abstract = {Self-determination theory (SDT) maintains that an understanding of human motiva-tion requires a consideration of innate psychological needs for competence, auton-omy, and relatedness. We discuss the SDT concept of needs as it relates to previous need theories, emphasizing that needs specify the necessary conditions for psycholog-ical growth, integrity, and well-being. This concept of needs leads to the hypotheses that different regulatory processes underlying goal pursuits are differentially associ-ated with effective functioning and well-being and also that different goal contents have different relations to the quality of behavior and mental health, specifically be-cause different regulatory processes and different goal contents are associated with differing degrees of need satisfaction. Social contexts and individual differences that support satisfaction of the basic needs facilitate natural growth processes including intrinsically motivated behavior and integration of extrinsic motivations, whereas those that forestall autonomy, competence, or relatedness are associated with poorer motivation, performance, and well-being. We also discuss the relation of the psycho-logical needs to cultural values, evolutionary processes, and other contemporary mo-tivation theories.},

How-ever, research suggests that the benefits of peer review are obtained inconsistently. This paper explores why, introduc-ing three ways that framing task goals significantly changes reviews. Three experiments manipulated features in the review environment. First, adding a numeric scale to open text reviews was found to elicit more explanatory, but lower quality reviews. Second, structuring a review task into short, chunked stages elicited more diverse feedback. Final-ly, showing reviewers a draft along with finished work elic-ited reviews that focused more on the work's goals than aesthetic details. These findings demonstrate the im-portance of carefully structuring online learning environ-ments to ensure high quality peer reviews.},

abstract = {We introduce a new approach to the ma- chine-assisted grading of short answer ques- tions. We follow past work in automated grading by first training a similarity metric between student responses, but then go on to use this metric to group responses into clus- ters and subclusters. The resulting group- ings allow teachers to grade multiple re- sponses with a single action, provide rich feedback to groups of similar answers, and discover modalities of misunderstanding among students; we refer to this amplifica- tion of grader effort as “powergrading.” We develop the means to further reduce teacher effort by automatically performing actions when an answer key is available. We show results in terms of grading progress with a small “budget” of human actions, both from our method and an LDA-based approach, on a test corpus of 10 questions answered by 698 respondents.},

abstract = {We present a new method for automatically providing feedback for introductory programming problems. In order to use this method, we need a reference implementation of the assignment, and an er- ror model consisting of potential corrections to errors that students might make. Using this information, the system automatically de- rives minimal corrections to student's incorrect solutions, providing them with a quantifiable measure of exactly how incorrect a given solution was, as well as feedback about what they did wrong. We introduce a simple language for describing error models in terms of correction rules, and formally define a rule-directed translation strategy that reduces the problem of finding minimal corrections in an incorrect program to the problem of synthesizing a correct program from a sketch.We have evaluated our system on thousands of real student attempts obtained from 6.00 and 6.00x. Our results show that relatively simple error models can correct on average 65{\%} of all incorrect submissions.},

In our research, we manipulated the design of an online math game to investigate the effect of challenge on player motivation and learning. To test the $\backslash$'1cInverted-U Hypothesis$\backslash$'1d, which predicts that maximum game engagement will occur with moderate challenge, we produced two large-scale (10K and 70K subjects), multi-factor (2x3 and 2x9x8x4x25) online experiments. We found that, in almost all cases, subjects were more engaged and played longer when the game was easier, which seems to contradict the generality of the Inverted-U Hypothesis. Troublingly, we also found that the most engaging design conditions produced the slowest rates of learning. Based on our findings, we describe several design implications that may increase challenge-seeking in games, such as providing feedforward about the anticipated degree of challenge.},

Hint systems that provide personalized feedback to students in real time are a central component of many effective interactive learning environments, however little is known about how hints impact player behavior and motivation in educational games. In this work, we study the effectiveness of hints by comparing four designs based on successful hint systems in intelligent tutoring systems and commercial games. We present results from a study of 50,000 students showing that all four hint systems negatively impacted performance compared to a baseline condition with no hints. These results suggest that traditional hint systems may not translate well into the educational game environment, highlighting the importance of studying student behavior to understand the impact of new interactive learning technologies.},

We demonstrate the need for a finer grained analysis of answers than is supported by current tutoring systems or entailment databases and describe a new representation for reference answers that addresses these issues, breaking them into detailed facets and annotating their entailment relationships to the student's answer more precisely. Human annotation at this detailed level still results in substantial interannotator agreement, 86.2{\%}, with a Kappa statistic of 0.728. We also present our current efforts to automatically assess student answers, which involves training machine learning classifiers on features extracted from dependency parses of the reference answer and student's response and features derived from domain independent lexical statistics. Our system's performance, as high as 75.5{\%} accuracy within domain and 68.8{\%} out of domain, is very encouraging and confirms the approach is feasible. Another significant contribution of this work is that it represents a significant step in the direction of providing domain independent semantic assessment of answers. No prior work in the area of tutoring or educational assessment has attempted to build such domain independent systems. They have virtually all required hundreds of examples of learner answers for each new question in order to train aspects of their systems or to hand craft information extraction templates.},

abstract = {This article is a review of experiments comparing the effectiveness of human tutoring, computer tutoring, and no tutoring. “No tutoring” refers to instruction that teaches the same content without tutoring. The computer tutoring systems were divided by their granularity of the user interface interaction into answer-based, step-based, and substep-based tutoring systems. Most intelligent tutoring systems have step-based or substep-based granularities of interaction, whereas most other tutoring systems (often called CAI, CBT, or CAL systems) have answer-based user interfaces. It is widely believed as the granularity of tutoring decreases, the effectiveness increases. In particular, when compared to No tutoring, the effect sizes of answer-based tutoring systems, intelligent tutoring systems, and adult human tutors are believed to be d = 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0 respectively. This review did not confirm these beliefs. Instead, it found that the effect size of human tutoring was much lower: d = 0.79. Moreover, the effect size of intelligent tutoring systems was 0.76, so they are nearly as effective as human tutoring.},

abstract = {Data curation is the act of discovering a data source(s) of in- terest, cleaning and transforming the new data, semantically integrating it with other local data sources, and deduplicat- ing the resulting composite. There has been much research on the various components of curation (especially data inte- gration and deduplication). However, there has been little work on collecting all of the curation components into an integrated end-to-end system.$\backslash$nIn addition, most of the previous work will not scale to the sizes of problems that we are finding in the field. For exam- ple, one web aggregator requires the curation of 80,000 URLs and a second biotech company has the problem of curating 8000 spreadsheets. At this scale, data curation cannot be a manual (human) effort, but must entail machine learning approaches with a human assist only when necessary.$\backslash$nThis paper describes Data Tamer, an end-to-end curation system we have built at M.I.T. Brandeis, and Qatar Com- puting Research Institute (QCRI). It expects as input a se- quence of data sources to add to a composite being con- structed over time. A new source is subjected to ma- chine learning algorithms to perform attribute identification, grouping of attributes into tables, transformation of incom- ing data and deduplication. When necessary, a human can be asked for guidance. Also, Data Tamer includes a data visualization component so a human can examine a data source at will and specify manual transformations.$\backslash$nWe have run Data Tamer on three real world enterprise cura- tion problems, and it has been shown to lower curation cost by about 90{\%}, relative to the currently deployed production software.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {A method of dynamically constructing Markov chain models that describe the characteristics of binary messages is developed. Such models can be used to predict future message characters and can therefore be used as a basis for data compression. To this end, the Markov modelling technique is combined with Guazzo's arithmetic coding scheme to produce a powerful method of data compression. The method has the advantage of being adaptive: messages may be encoded or decoded with just a single pass through the data. Experimental results reported here indicate that.the Markov modelling approach generally achieves much better data compression than that observed with competing methods on typical computer data},

Yet this hypothesis has not been systematically explored by researchers, and conceptual design has not played the central role in the research and teaching of software engineering that one might expect. As part of a new research project to explore conceptual design, we are engaging in a series of case studies. This paper reports on the early stages of our first study, on the Git version control system. Despite its widespread adoption, Git puzzles even experienced developers and is not regarded as easy to use. In an attempt to understand the root causes of its complexity, we analyze its conceptual model and identify some undesirable properties; we then propose a reworking of the conceptual model that forms the basis of (the first version of) Gitless, an ongoing effort to redesign Git and experiment with the effects of conceptual simplifications.},

abstract = {We are at an important technological inflection point. Most of our computing systems have been designed and built by professionally trained experts (i.e. us-computer scientists, engineers, and designers) for use in specific domains and to solve explicit problems. Artifacts often called "user manuals" traditionally prescribed the appropriate usage of these tools and implied an acceptable etiquette for interaction and experience. A fringe group of individuals usually labeled "hackers" or "nerds" have challenged this producer-consumer model of technology by hacking novel hardware and software features to "improve" our research and products while a similar creative group of technicians called "artists" have re-directed the techniques, tools, and tenets of accepted technological usage away from their typical manifestations in practicality and product. Over time the technological artifacts of these fringe groups and the support for their rhetoric have gained them a foothold into computing culture and eroded the established power discontinuities within the practice of computing research. We now expect our computing tools to be driven by an architecture of open participation and democracy that encourages users to add value to their tools and applications as they use them. Similarly, the bar for enabling the design of novel, personal computing systems and "hardware remixes" has fallen to the point where many non-experts and novices are readily embracing and creating fascinating and ingenious computing artifacts outside of our official and traditionally sanctioned academic research communities.},

Later, the term "crowdsourcing" was coined by Jeff Howe in 2006. Since then, a lot of work in crowd sourcing has focused on different aspects of crowd sourcing, such as computational techniques and performance analysis.

If the human good, the ultimate end of human action, is the public good, then when each citizen asks, 'What is the ultimate goal of my actions?' the correct answer should be, 'the eudaimonia of my polis'.},

abstract = {Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving perfor- mance that equals or even beats humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn, and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (a) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recog- nition problems; (b) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology, to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (c) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes towards these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.},

However, the growth is not adequately supported by a framework with which to understand each new system in the context of the old. We classify human computation systems to help identify parallels between different systems and reveal ―holes‖ in the existing work as opportunities for new research. Since human computation is often confused with ―crowdsourcing‖ and other terms, we explore the position of human computation with respect to these related topics},

@article{Duckworth2011,
abstract = {Intelligence tests are widely assumed to measure maximal intellectual performance, and predictive associations between intelligence quotient (IQ) scores and later-life outcomes are typically interpreted as unbiased estimates of the effect of intellectual ability on academic, professional, and social life outcomes. The current investigation critically examines these assumptions and finds evidence against both. First, we examined whether motivation is less than maximal on intelligence tests administered in the context of low-stakes research situations. Specifically, we completed a meta-analysis of random-assignment experiments testing the effects of material incentives on intelligence-test performance on a collective 2,008 participants. Incentives increased IQ scores by an average of 0.64 SD, with larger effects for individuals with lower baseline IQ scores. Second, we tested whether individual differences in motivation during IQ testing can spuriously inflate the predictive validity of intelligence for life outcomes. Trained observers rated test motivation among 251 adolescent boys completing intelligence tests using a 15-min "thin-slice" video sample. IQ score predicted life outcomes, including academic performance in adolescence and criminal convictions, employment, and years of education in early adulthood. After adjusting for the influence of test motivation, however, the predictive validity of intelligence for life outcomes was significantly diminished, particularly for nonacademic outcomes. Collectively, our findings suggest that, under low-stakes research conditions, some individuals try harder than others, and, in this context, test motivation can act as a third-variable confound that inflates estimates of the predictive validity of intelligence for life outcomes.},

abstract = {When the terms “intelligence” or “intelligent” are used by scientists, they are re- ferring to a large collection of human cognitive behaviors—people thinking. When life scientists speak of the intelligence of animals, they are asking us to call to mind a set of human behaviors that they are asserting the animals are (or are not) capable of. When computer scientists speak of artificial intelligence, machine intelligence, intelligent agents, or (as I chose to do in the title of this essay) computational intel- ligence, we are also referring to that set of human behaviors. Although intelligence means people thinking, we might be able to replicate the same set of behaviors using computation. Indeed, one branch of modern cognitive psychology is based on the model that the human mind and brain are complex computational “engines,” that is, we ourselves are examples of computational intelligence.},

We use Markov decision processes to model players' actions within a game, and then make inferences about the parameters of a cognitive model from these actions. We present a general framework for finding games with high ex- pected information gain based on this approach. We apply this framework to Boolean concept learning, inferring the difficulty of Boolean concepts from participants' behavior. We show that using games with higher expected information gain allows us to make this inference more efficiently.},

abstract = {Basic decisions, such as judging a person as a friend or foe, involve categorizing novel stimuli. Recent work finds that people's category judgments are guided by a small set of examples that are retrieved from memory at decision time. This limited and stochastic retrieval places limits on human performance for proba-bilistic classification decisions. In light of this capacity limitation, recent work finds that idealizing training items, such that the saliency of ambiguous cases is reduced, improves human performance on novel test items. One shortcoming of previous work in idealization is that category distributions were idealized in an ad hoc or heuristic fashion. In this contribution, we take a first principles approach to constructing idealized training sets. We apply a machine teaching procedure to a cognitive model that is either limited capacity (as humans are) or unlimited capacity (as most machine learning systems are). As predicted, we find that the machine teacher recommends idealized training sets. We also find that human learners perform best when training recommendations from the machine teacher are based on a limited-capacity model. As predicted, to the extent that the learning model used by the machine teacher conforms to the true nature of human learners, the recommendations of the machine teacher prove effective. Our results provide a normative basis (given capacity constraints) for idealization procedures and offer a novel selection procedure for models of human learning.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been increasing interest in the phenomena of "gaming the system," where a learner attempts to succeed in an educational environment by exploiting properties of the system's help and feedback rather than by attempting to learn the material. Developing environments that respond constructively and effectively to gaming depends upon understanding why students choose to game. In this article, we present three studies, conducted with two different learning environments, which present evidence on which student behaviors, motivations, and emotions are associated with the choice to game the system. We also present a fourth study to determine how teachers' perspectives on gaming behavior are similar to, and different from, researchers' perspectives and the data from our studies. We discuss what motivational and attitudinal patterns are associated with gaming behavior across studies, and what the implications are for the design of interactive learning environment.

At a given point in time, the system tries to propose to the student the activity which makes him progress best. We introduce two algorithms that rely on the empirical estimation of the learning progress, one that uses information about the dif- ficulty of each exercise RiARiT and another that does not use any knowledge about the problem ZPDES. The system is based on the combination of three approaches. First, it leverages recent models of intrinsically motivated learning by transposing them to active teaching, relying on empirical estimation of learning progress provided by spe- cific activities to particular students. Second, it uses state- of-the-artMulti-Arm Bandit (MAB) techniques to efficiently manage the exploration/exploitation challenge of this op- timization process. Third, it leverages expert knowledge to constrain and bootstrap initial exploration of the MAB, while requiring only coarse guidance information of the ex- pert and allowing the system to deal with didactic gaps in its knowledge.},

We first introduce the typical formulation of GT in the WSN application domain. The roles of GT are described that include routing protocol design, topology control, power control and energy saving, packet forwarding, data collection, spectrum allocation, bandwidth allocation, quality of service control, coverage optimization, WSN security, and other sensor management tasks. Then, three variations of game theory are described, namely, the cooperative, non-cooperative, and repeated schemes. Finally, existing problems and future trends are identified for researchers and engineers in the field. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Deep Learning models have shown superior performance for robust prediction in computational phenotyping tasks, but suffer from the issue of model interpretability which is crucial for clinicians involved in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce a novel knowledge-distillation approach called Interpretable Mimic Learning, to learn interpretable phenotype features for making robust prediction while mimicking the performance of deep learning models. Our framework uses Gradient Boosting Trees to learn interpretable features from deep learning models such as Stacked Denoising Autoencoder and Long Short-Term Memory. Exhaustive experiments on a real-world clinical time-series dataset show that our method obtains similar or better performance than the deep learning models, and it provides interpretable phenotypes for clinical decision making.},

abstract = {We describe a method of automatic feedback provision for students learning programming and computational methods in Python. We have implemented, used and refined this system since 2009 for growing student numbers, and summarise the design and experience of using it. The core idea is to use a unit testing framework: the teacher creates a set of unit tests, and the student code is tested by running these tests. With our implementation, students typically submit work for assessment, and receive feedback by email within a few minutes after submission. The choice of tests and the reporting back to the student is chosen to optimise the educational value for the students. The system very significantly reduces the staff time required to establish whether a student's solution is correct, and shifts the emphasis of computing laboratory student contact time from assessing correctness to providing guidance. The self-paced nature of the automatic feedback provision supports a student-centred learning approach. Students can re-submit their work repeatedly and iteratively improve their solution, and enjoy using the system. We include an evaluation of the system and data from using it in a class of 425 students.},

abstract = {Questions demanding subjective (open) responses have been considered to be the most desirable assessment format in order to gauge candidate learning. Such ques- tions allow candidates to express creatively and help evaluators to understand a candidate's thought process. The evaluation of such subjective responses, how- ever, has traditionally required human expertise and is challenging to automate. On the other hand, automated assessments provide scalability, standardization and efficiency. Given the recent shift towards online learning and the massive scale of operations, there is a need to develop systems which can combine advantages of both, expert assessors and automated systems. Drawing from attempts made by both, the machine learning community and ed- ucational phsychologists, we provide general principles on how any subjective evaluation problem can be cast in the framework of machine learning. These principles highlight the various choices and challenges one would need to con- sider while devising a machine learning based assessment system. We go on to demonstrate, as a case-study, how a system to assess computer programs has been successfully designed using the principles described.},

We are particularly interested in training novice workers to perform well on solving tasks in situations where the space of strategies is large and workers need to discover and try different strategies to be successful. In a first experiment, we perform a comparison of five differ-ent training strategies. For complex web search challenges, we show that providing expert examples is an effective form of training, surpassing other forms of training in nearly all measures of interest. However, such training relies on ac-cess to domain expertise, which may be expensive or lacking. Therefore, in a second experiment we study the feasibility of training workers in the absence of domain expertise. We show that having workers validate the work of their peer workers can be even more effective than having them review expert examples if we only present solutions filtered by a thresh-old length. The results suggest that crowdsourced solutions of peer workers may be harnessed in an automated training pipeline.},

abstract = {Online discussion forums are one of the most ubiquitous kinds of resources for people who are learning computer programming. However, their user interface - a hierarchy of textual threads - has not changed much in the past four decades. We argue that generic forum interfaces are cumbersome for learning programming and that there is a need for a domain-specific visual discussion forum for programming. We support this argument with an empirical study of all 5,377 forum threads in Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, a popular edX MOOC. Specifically, we investigated how forum participants were hampered by its text-based format. Most notably, people often wanted to discuss questions about dynamic execution state - what happens {\&}{\#}x201C;under the hood{\&}{\#}x201D; as the computer runs code. We propose that a better forum for learning programming should be visual and domain-specific, integrating automatically-generated visualizations of execution state and enabling inline annotations of source code and output.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing, outsourcing of tasks to a crowd of unknown people ("workers") in an open call, is rapidly rising in popularity. It is already being heavily used by numerous employers ("requesters") for solving a wide variety of tasks, such as audio transcription, content screening, and labeling training data for machine learning. However, quality control of such tasks continues to be a key challenge because of the high variability in worker quality. In this paper we show the value of decision-theoretic techniques for the problem of optimizing workflows used in crowdsourcing. In particular, we design AI agents that use Bayesian network learning and inference in combination with Partially-Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) for obtaining excellent cost-quality tradeoffs. We use these techniques for three distinct crowdsourcing scenarios: (1) control of voting to answer a binary-choice question, (2) control of an iterative improvement workflow, and (3) control of switching between alternate workflows for a task. In each scenario, we design a Bayes net model that relates worker competency, task difficulty and worker response quality. We also design a POMDP for each task, whose solution provides the dynamic control policy. We demonstrate the usefulness of our models and agents in live experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We consistently achieve superior quality results than non-adaptive controllers, while incurring equal or less cost. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The hypothesis is that Assistments both assist students while also assessing them. This paper describes the Assistment system and some preliminary results.},

abstract = {Common exam practice centres around two question types: code tracing (reading) and code writing. It is commonly believed that code tracing is easier than code writing, but it seems obvious that different skills are needed for each. These problems also differ in their value on an exam. Pedagogically, code tracing on paper is an authentic task whereas code writing on paper is less so. Yet, few instructors are willing to forgo the code writing question on an exam. Is there another way, easier to grade, that captures the "problem solving through code creation process" we wish to examine? In this paper we propose Parson's puzzle-style problems for this purpose. We explore their potential both qualitatively, through interviews, and quantitatively through a set of CS1 exams. We find notable correlation between Parsons scores and code writing scores. We find low correlation between code writing and tracing and between Parsons and tracing. We also make the case that marks from a Parsons problem make clear what students don't know (specifically, in both syntax and logic) much less ambiguously than marks from a code writing problem. We make recommendations on the design of Parsons problems for the exam setting, discuss their potential uses and urge further investigations of Parsons problems for assessment of CS1 students.},

There has been sub-stantial research on tracking and modeling student learning, but significantly less attention on how to plan teaching actions and how the assumed student model impacts the resulting plans. We frame the problem of optimally selecting teaching actions using a decision-theoretic approach and show how to formulate teaching as a partially observable Markov decision process planning prob-lem. This framework makes it possible to explore how different assumptions about student learn-ing and behavior should affect the selection of teaching actions. We consider how to apply this framework to concept learning problems, and we present approximate methods for finding optimal teaching actions, given the large state and action spaces that arise in teaching. Through simula-tions and behavioral experiments, we explore the consequences of choosing teacher actions under different assumed student models. In two concept-learning tasks, we show that this technique can accelerate learning relative to baseline performance.},

While not an unreasonable assumption for tasks that can be posited as multiple-choice questions (e.g. n-ary classification), we observe that many tasks do not naturally fit this paradigm, but instead demand a free-response formulation where the outcome space is of infinite size (e.g. audio transcription). We model such tasks with a novel probabilistic graphical model, and design and implement LazySusan, a decision-theoretic controller that dynamically requests responses as necessary in order to infer answers to these tasks. We also design an EM algorithm to jointly learn the parameters of our model while inferring the correct answers to multiple tasks at a time. Live experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk demonstrate the superiority of LazySusan at solving SAT Math questions, eliminating 83.2{\%} of the error and achieving greater net utility compared to the state-ofthe- art strategy, majority-voting. We also show in live experiments that our EM algorithm outperforms majority-voting on a visualization task that we design.},

The project-based class used Watson to support bio-logically inspired design, a design paradigm that uses bio-logical systems as analogues for inventing technological systems. The twenty-four students in the class self-organized into six teams of four students each, and devel-oped semester-long projects that built on Watson to support biologically inspired design. In this paper, we describe this experiment in using Watson to teach about human-computer co-creativity, present one project in detail, and summarize the remaining five projects. We also draw lessons on build-ing on Watson for (i) supporting biologically inspired de-sign, and (ii) enhancing human-computer co-creativity. Background, Motivations and Goals},

abstract = {Model-based design and automated code generation are increasingly used at NASA to produce actual flight code, particularly in the Guidance, Navigation, and Control domain. However, since code generators are typically not qualified, there is no guarantee that their output is correct, and consequently auto-generated code still needs to be fully tested and certified. We have thus developed AutoCert, a generator-independent plug-in that supports the certification of auto-generated code. AutoCert takes a set of mission safety requirements, and formally verifies that the auto-generated code satisfies these requirements. It generates a natural language report that explains why and how the code complies with the specified requirements. The report is hyper-linked to both the program and the verification conditions and thus provides a high-level structured argument containing tracing information for use in code reviews.},

abstract = {An e ective tutor|human or digital|must determine what a student does and does not know. Inferring a student's knowledge state is challenging because behavioral observa- tions (e.g., correct vs. incorrect problem solution) provide only weak evidence. Two classes of models have been pro- posed to address the challenge. Latent-factor models em- ploy a collaborative ltering approach in which data from a population of students solving a population of problems is used to predict the performance of an individual student on a speci c problem. Knowledge-tracing models exploit a student's sequence of problem-solving attempts to deter- mine the point at which a skill is mastered. Although these two approaches are complementary, only preliminary, infor- mal steps have been taken to integrate them. We propose a principled synthesis of the two approaches in a hierarchi- cal Bayesian model that predicts student performance by integrating a theory of the temporal dynamics of learning with a theory of individual di erences among students and problems. We present results from three data sets from the DataShop repository indicating that the integrated archi- tecture outperforms either alone. We nd signi cant predic- tive value in considering the diculty of speci c problems (within a skill), a source of information that has rarely been exploited.},

abstract = {Die Zukunft war fr{\"{u}}her auch besser. (The future was better in the past, as well.) Karl Valentin Abstract In April 1981 Xerox introduced the Star 8010 workstation, the first commercial system with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the first to use the “desktop” metaphor to organize a user's interactions with the computer. Despite the perception of huge progress, from the perspective of design and usage models, there has been precious little progress in the intervening years. In the tradition of Rip van Winkle, a Macintosh user who awoke today, after having fallen asleep in 1984, would have no more trouble operating a “modern” PC than operating a modern car. The “desktop” is still the dominant user interface paradigm. Equally durable is the “general purpose” nature of PC design, which assumes that we channel all our transactions (a diverse lot) through a single interface on a single computer. While common discourse about digital media is dominated by the concept of convergence, we argue that from the perspective of the usage model, just the opposite concept, divergence, should be the dominant model. We argue that the diversity of web browsers tomorrow will match the diversity of “ink browsers” (a.k.a. paper) today. Systems will have to be tailored to dynamically connect the user with artefacts relevant to the user's current actions -- and do so in a way, form, place, and cost appropriate to the user. This change is as inevitable as it is essential. In the end, it will leave us with new concepts of computers, communications, and computing -- and of computer science itself. Few computer science departments or computer firms appreciate the magnitude of the impending change. It is time for them to wake up.},

We show through behavioral studies that humans em-ploy three distinct teaching strategies, one of which is consistent with the curricu-lum learning principle, and propose a novel theoretical framework as a potential explanation for this strategy. This framework, which assumes a teaching goal of minimizing the learner's expected generalization error at each iteration, extends the standard teaching dimension model and offers a theoretical justification for curriculum learning.},

The second is that there has yet to develop a centralized space where researchers, technologists, and course designers can share their findings or come to consensus on approaches for making sense of these emergent virtual learning environments.},

It explores the reasons why documents have been late to come under ethnographic scrutiny and the implications for our theo- retical understandings of organizations and methods for studying them. The review argues for the great value of the study of paper-mediated documentation to the study of electronic forms, but it also highlights the risk of an exclusive focus on paper, making anthropology marginal to the study of core bureaucratic practices in the manner of earlier anthropology},

However, mClerk is not limited to text: it leverages a little-known protocol to send small images via ordinary SMS, enabling novel distribution of graphical tasks. Via a 5-week deployment in semi-urban India, we demonstrate that mClerk is effective for digitizing local-language documents. Usage of mClerk spread virally from 10 users to 239 users, who digitized over 25,000 words during the study. We discuss the social ecosystem surrounding this usage, and evaluate the potential of mobile crowdsourcing to both deliver and derive value from users in developing regions.},

We frame the problem of optimally selecting teaching actions using a decision-theoretic approach and show how to formulate teaching as a partially observable Markov decision process planning prob-lem. This framework makes it possible to explore how different assumptions about student learn-ing and behavior should affect the selection of teaching actions. We consider how to apply this framework to concept learning problems, and we present approximate methods for finding optimal teaching actions, given the large state and action spaces that arise in teaching. Through simula-tions and behavioral experiments, we explore the consequences of choosing teacher actions under different assumed student models.

In observing mode students are simply browsing the online platform, watching videos, reading material, reading book or watching forums. In submitting mode, students submit information to the platform. This includes submissions towards quizzes, homeworks, or any assessment modules. In collaborating mode students interact with other students or instructors on forums, collaboratively editing wiki or chatting on google hangout or other hangout venues. With this basic definitions of activities, and a data model to store events pertaining to these activities, we then create a common terminology to map Coursera and edX data into this shared data model.

The MOOCs forums allow students to post comments and ask questions; due to the number of students, however, the course facilitators are not able to provide feedback in a timely manner. To address this problem, we identify content-knowledge related posts using a course domain ontology and provide students with timely informative automatic feedback. Moreover, we provide facilitators with feedback of students posts, such as frequent topics students ask about. Experimental results from one of the courses offered by Coursera show the potential of our approach in creating a responsive learning environment. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

abstract = {User contributions in the form of posts, comments, and votes are essential to the success of online communities. However, allowing user participation also invites undesirable behavior such as trolling. In this paper, we characterize antisocial behavior in three large online discussion communities by analyzing users who were banned from these communities. We find that such users tend to concentrate their efforts in a small number of threads, are more likely to post irrelevantly, and are more successful at garnering responses from other users. Studying the evolution of these users from the moment they join a community up to when they get banned, we find that not only do they write worse than other users over time, but they also become increasingly less tolerated by the community. Further, we discover that antisocial behavior is exacerbated when community feedback is overly harsh. Our analysis also reveals distinct groups of users with different levels of antisocial behavior that can change over time. We use these insights to identify antisocial users early on, a task of high practical importance to community maintainers.},

The digitization of educational course content has proved to be problematic for math instructors due to the lack of quality feedback tools that can accommodate the commenter to efficiently express math formulae and convey descriptions about complex ideas contextualized in situ. This paper proposes that RichReview, a document annotation system which creates inking, voice and deictic gestures on top of the student's submitted work, is a possible formative math feedback solution, because it enables face-to-face like commentary within the contexts of the document at hand. A preliminary qualitative evaluation study conducted while having students receive RichReview feedback showed promise to our approach to enhance the quality of feedback, with the implication that incorporating multi-modal feedback into workflows can be an effective method to address elements of feedback submissions lacking in coursework that has moved online.},

@article{Lamb2015,
abstract = {Massive open online course (MOOC) platforms increasingly allow easily implemented randomized experiments. The heterogeneity of MOOC students, however, leads to two methodological obstacles in analyzing interventions to increase engagement. (1) Many MOOC participation metrics have distributions with substantial positive skew from highly active users as well as zero-inflation from high attrition. (2) High attrition means that in some experimental designs, most users assigned to the treatment never receive it; analyses that do not consider attrition result in "intent-to-treat" (ITT) estimates that underestimate the true effects of interventions. We address these challenges in analyzing an intervention to improve forum participation in the 2014 JusticeX course offered on the edX MOOC platform. We compare the results of four ITT models (OLS, logistic, quantile, and zero-inflated negative binomial regressions) and three "treatment-ontreated" (TOT) models (Wald estimator, 2SLS with a second stage logistic model, and instrumental variables quantile regression). A combination of logistic, quantile, and zero-inflated negative binomial regressions provide the most comprehensive description of the ITT effects. TOT methods then adjust the ITT underestimates. Substantively, we demonstrate that self-assessment questions about forum participation encourage more students to engage in forums and increases the participation of already active students.},

Using DNA to archive data is an attractive possibility because it is extremely dense, with a raw limit of 1 exabyte/mm 3 ( 10 9 GB/mm 3 ), and long-lasting, with observed half-life of over 500 years. This paper presents an architecture for a DNA-based archival storage system. It is structured as a key-value store, and leverages common biochemical techniques to provide random access. We also propose a new encoding scheme that offers controllable redundancy, trading off reliability for density. We demonstrate feasibility, random access, and ro- bustness of the proposed encoding with wet lab experiments involving 151 kB of synthesized DNA and a 42 kB random- access subset, and simulation experiments of larger sets cali- brated to the wet lab experiments. Finally, we highlight trends in biotechnology that indicate the impending practicality of DNA storage for much larger datasets.},

abstract = {Teachers in conventional classrooms often ask learners to express themselves and show their thought processes by speaking out loud, drawing on a whiteboard, or even using physical objects. Despite the pedagogical value of such activities, interactive exercises available in most online learning platforms are constrained to multiple-choice and short answer questions. We introduce RIMES, a system for easily authoring, recording, and reviewing interactive multimedia exercises embedded in lecture videos. With RIMES, teachers can prompt learners to record their responses to an activity using video, audio, and inking while watching lecture videos. Teachers can then review and interact with all the learners' responses in an aggregated gallery. We evaluated RIMES with 19 teachers and 25 students. Teachers created a diverse set of activities across multiple subjects that tested deep conceptual and procedural knowledge. Teachers found the exercises useful for capturing students' thought processes, identifying misconceptions, and engaging students with content.},

We develop mathematical models to study the precise tradeoffs between task performance quality, level of privacy against collusion attacks, and cost of invoking a large crowd. Such a study provides design strategies and principles for crowd work. The use of classification codes may improve efficiency considerably.

abstract = {Human behavior increasingly involves digital online software, where the activities and resources that support (1) learning, (2) work, and (3) collaboration overlap and are placed in far greater proximity than the physical world - often just a browser-tab or window away. What scientific and practical gains in 21st century learning, work, and collaboration can be achieved by integrating and contrasting these three areas' relevant technologies, scientific communities, and industry practitioners? For example: How can software for collaborative work incorporate learning? Which methods are effective for coordinating diverse experts to iteratively improve online educational resources? How can online learning improve the skill set and labor force for crowd work? What kinds of computational frameworks exist to jointly optimize the learning of skills and the use of these skills to achieve practical goals? This workshop tackles such questions by bringing together participants from industry (e.g., platforms similar to oDesk, Amazon Mechanical Turk); education, psychology, and MOOCs (e.g., attendees of AERA, EDM, AIED, Learning at Scale); crowdsourcing and collaborative work (e.g., attendees of CHI, CSCW, NIPS, AAAI's HCOMP).},

abstract = {This paper adapts topic models to the psychometric testing of MOOC students based on their online forum postings. Measurement theory from education and psychology provides statistical models for quantifying a person's attainment of intangible attributes such as attitudes, abilities or intelligence. Such models infer latent skill levels by relating them to individuals' observed responses on a series of items such as quiz questions. The set of items can be used to measure a latent skill if individuals' responses on them conform to a Guttman scale. Such well-scaled items differentiate between individuals and inferred levels span the entire range from most basic to the advanced. In practice, education researchers manually devise items (quiz questions) while optimising well-scaled conformance. Due to the costly nature and expert requirements of this process, psychometric testing has found limited use in everyday teaching. We aim to develop usable measurement models for highly-instrumented MOOC delivery platforms, by using participation in automatically-extracted online forum topics as items. The challenge is to formalise the Guttman scale educational constraint and incorporate it into topic models. To favour topics that automatically conform to a Guttman scale, we introduce a novel regularisation into non-negative matrix factorisation-based topic modelling. We demonstrate the suitability of our approach with both quantitative experiments on three Coursera MOOCs, and with a qualitative survey of topic interpretability on two MOOCs by domain expert interviews.},

We present a mathematical model that captures these issues in idealized form. The student's needs are modeled as constraints on the schedule according to which educational material and review are spaced over time. Our results include algorithms to construct schedules that adhere to various spacing constraints, and bounds on the rate at which new material can be introduced under these schedules.},

The context for this exploration is a module provided by a networked, and geographically dispersed, higher education institution. An evaluation of the module draws on the experiences of students and tutors participating in their first online course. Based on these experiences and the research literature, the paper discusses the extent to which face-to-face models of communication should be recreated in online contexts and the extent to which tutors should structure online interaction patterns and modes of discourse. Also examined is the way in which online learning leads to new 'hybrid' and 'converging' styles of communication and to the intermixing of academic and personal discourses. Overall, it is argued that the social context of online learning is qualitatively different from face-to-face learning and that this has significant implications for online learning design.},

In this model we take into account such basic properties of social networks as the dynamics of the intensity of interactions, the influence of public opinion, and the fact that in every human interaction it might be convenient to deceive or withhold information depending on the instantaneous situation of each individual in the network. We find that lies shape the topology of social networks, especially the formation of tightly linked, small communities with loose connections between them. We also find that agents with a larger proportion of deceptive interactions are the ones that connect communities of different opinion, and in this sense they have substantial centrality in the network. We then discuss the consequences of these results for the social behaviour of humans and predict the changes that could arise due to a varying tolerance for lies in society.},

It reports findings from a study of whether and how MOOC log file data can assist in understanding how MOOC participants use (often) messy, chaotic forums to support complex, unpredictable, contingent learning processes. It is argued that descriptions of posting, voting and viewing behaviours do not in and of themselves provide insights about how learning is generated in MOOC forums. Rather, it is hypothesised that there is a skill involved in using forums to learn; that theory-informed descriptions of this skill illustrate how MOOC participants use forums differently as they progress from novice to expert; that the skill progression can be validated through the use of forum log file data; and that log file data can also be used to assess an individual MOOC participant's position in relation to this progression -- that is, to measure an individual's skill in learning through forums and similar educational settings. These hypotheses were examined using data drawn from forums in a large MOOC run at the University of Melbourne in 2013.},

The Internet has made online learning possible, and many researchers and educators are interested in online learning to enhance and improve student learning outcomes while combating the reduction in resources, particularly in higher education. It is imperative that researchers and educators consider the effectiveness of online learning compared to traditional face-to-face format and the factors that influence the effectiveness of online courses. This study examines the evidence of the effectiveness of online learning by organizing and summarizing the findings and challenges of online learning into positive, negative, mixed, and null findings. Particular attention is paid to the meta-analyses on the effectiveness of online learning, the heterogenous outcomes of student learning and the endogenous issue of learning environment choice. Taken as a whole, there is robust evidence to suggest online learning is generally at least as effective as the traditional format. Moreover, this body of literature suggests that researchers should move beyond the “no significant difference” phenomenon and consider the next stage of online learning.},

This paper presents results from a detailed study of students' learning outcomes and patterns of interaction within an online discussion forum. The findings suggest that the typical nonlinear branching structure of online discussion may be insufficient for the realisation of truly conversational modes of learning.

abstract = {Fame, popularity and celebrity status, frequently used tokens of success, are often loosely related to, or even divorced from professional performance. This dichotomy is partly rooted in the difficulty to distinguish performance, an individual measure that captures the actions of a performer, from success, a collective measure that captures a community's reactions to these actions. Yet, finding the relationship between the two measures is essential for all areas that aim to objectively reward excellence, from science to business. Here we quantify the relationship between performance and success by focusing on tennis, an individual sport where the two quantities can be independently measured. We show that a predictive model, relying only on a tennis player's performance in tournaments, can accurately predict an athlete's popularity, both during a player's active years and after retirement. Hence the model establishes a direct link between performance and momentary popularity. The agreement between the performance-driven and observed popularity suggests that in most areas of human achievement exceptional visibility may be rooted in detectable performance measures.},

abstract = {The Web has enabled one of the most visible recent developments in education---the deployment of massive open online courses. With their global reach and often staggering enrollments, MOOCs have the potential to become a major new mechanism for learning. Despite this early promise, however, MOOCs are still relatively unexplored and poorly understood. In a MOOC, each student's complete interaction with the course materials takes place on the Web, thus providing a record of learner activity of unprecedented scale and resolution. In this work, we use such trace data to develop a conceptual framework for understanding how users currently engage with MOOCs. We develop a taxonomy of individual behavior, examine the different behavioral patterns of high- and low-achieving students, and investigate how forum participation relates to other parts of the course. We also report on a large-scale deployment of badges as incentives for engagement in a MOOC, including randomized experiments in which the presentation of badges was varied across sub-populations. We find that making badges more salient produced increases in forum engagement.},

abstract = {Figure 1. A text article containing a distance, alongside three personalized spatial analogies generated by our system for a user in San Jose, Seattle, and Chicago. ABSTRACT Distances and areas frequently appear in text articles. How-ever, people struggle to understand these measurements when they cannot relate them to measurements of locations that they are personally familiar with. We contribute tools for gen-erating personalized spatial analogies: re-expressions that contextualize spatial measurements in terms of locations with similar measurements that are more familiar to the user. Our automated approach takes a user's location and generates a personalized spatial analogy for a target distance or area us-ing landmarks. We present an interactive application that tags distances, areas, and locations in a text article and presents personalized spatial analogies using interactive maps. We find that users who view a personalized spatial analogy map generated by our system rate the helpfulness of the informa-tion for understanding a distance or area 1.9 points higher (on a 7 pt scale) than when they see the article with no spa-tial analogy and 0.7 points higher than when they see generic spatial analogy.},

Advocates of scientific and civic literacy are concerned with improving how people estimate and comprehend risks, measure-ments, and frequencies, but relatively little progress has been made in this direction. In this article we describe and test a framework to help people comprehend numerical measurements through sim-ple sentences, termed perspectives, that employ ratios, ranks, and unit changes to make them easier to understand. We use a crowd-sourced system to generate perspectives for a wide range of num-bers taken from online news articles. We then test the effectiveness of these perspectives in three randomized, online experiments in-volving over 3,200 participants. We find that perspective clauses substantially improve people's ability to recall measurements they have read, estimate ones they have not, and detect errors in manip-ulated measurements. We see this as the first of many steps in using digital platforms to improve numeracy among online readers.},

abstract = {When modeling student learning, tutors that use the Knowl- edge Tracing framework often assume that all students have the same set of model parameters. We find that when fitting parameters to individual students, there is significant varia- tion among the individual's parameters. We examine if this variation is important in terms of instructional decisions by computing the difference in the expected number of prac- tice opportunities required if mastery is assessed using an individual student's own estimated model parameters, com- pared to the population model. In the dataset considered, we find that a significant portion of students are expected to perform twice as many practice opportunities if the student ismodeled using a population-basedmodel, compared to the number needed if the student's own model parameters were used. We also find an additional significant portion of stu- dents will be likely to receive less practice opportunities than needed, implying that such students will be advanced too early. Though further work on additional datasets is needed to explore this issue in more depth, our results suggest that considering individual variation in student parameters may have important implications for the instructional decisions made in intelligent tutoring systems that use a Knowledge Tracing model. 1.},

abstract = {The ultimate proof of our understanding of natural or technological systems is reflected in our ability to control them. Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems towards a desired state, a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system's entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.},

The authors developed mobile application prototypes, storyboards, and process flows of the framework using IBS as the case study. The authors conducted three focus groups and an online survey using a human-centered design approach for assessing the framework's feasibility.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: All 6 focus group participants had a positive view about our framework and volunteered to participate in future studies. Most stated they would trust the results because it was their own data being analyzed. They were most concerned about confounds, nonmeaningful measures, and erroneous assumptions on the timing of trigger effects. Survey respondents (N = 60) were more likely to be adherent to an 8- vs 12-day study length even if it meant lower confidence results.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: Implementation of the self-experimentation framework in a mobile application appears to be feasible for people with IBS. This framework can likely be applied to other health conditions. Considerations include the learning curve for teaching self-experimentation to non-experts and the challenges involved in operationalizing and customizing study designs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Using mobile technology to guide people through self-experimentation to investigate health questions is a feasible and promising approach to advancing personalized health.},

abstract = {Despite the increase in massive open online courses (MOOCs), evidence about the pedagogy of learning in MOOCs remains limited. This paper reports on an investigation into the pedagogy in one MOOC - Oxford Brookes University's ‘First Steps in Learning and Teaching in Higher Education' MOOC (FSLT12). FSLT12 was an open and free professional development opportunity for people moving into HE teaching. It was a small course (200 participants registered from 24 countries) which was focused on introducing HE teaching skills, and, uniquely, to deliberately integrate open academic practice as a vital part of professional development for HE teachers. A qualitative, case-study approach was used in the research, based on surveys, interviews, and social media, to provide evidence about how people learned in this course and consider wider implications for teaching and learning in higher education. The evidence shows that participants who completed the course were able to learn autonomously and navigate the distributed platforms and environments. The most challenging issues were acceptance of open academic practice and difficulty in establishing an academic identity in an unpredictable virtual environment. An interesting and significant feature of the course was the support for learners from a number of MOOC ‘veterans' who served as role models and guides for less experienced MOOC learners. The research shows that small task-oriented MOOCs can effectively support professional development of open academic practice},

abstract = {Abstract New web technologies have enabled online education to take on a massive scale, prompting many universities to create massively open online courses (MOOCs) that take advantage of these tech- nologies in a seemingly effortless manner. Designing a MOOC, however, is anything but trivial. It involves developing content, learning activities, and assessments to accommodate both the massiveness and openness of the course. To design an effective MOOC, instructors need to inte- grate both pedagogical and information systems theory. In this paper, we present a case study of a MOOC grant and a series of decisions made in its development. These decisions, when paired with the theoretical framework, suggest five principles – meaningful, engaging, measurable, ac- cessible, and scalable – may be applicable to future MOOC development projects.},

We survey the evolving landscape of competing data models, all of which can be accommodated in the platform. Data model descriptions are provided to analytics authors who choose, much like with smartphone app stores, to write for any number of data models depending on their needs and the proliferation of the particular data model.

abstract = {Although past research has sought to identify the factors of student engagement in traditional online courses, two questions remained largely unanswered with regard to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs): do the factors that could influence student engagement in traditional online courses also apply to online courses that are massive and open? What factors do students consider important in terms of their perceived ability to promote a satisfying or engaging online learning experience? This paper reports a case study of three top-rated MOOCs in the disciplines of programming languages, literature, and arts {\&} design in order to address these very questions. Using a mixed methods approach that combines participant observation with analysis of reflection data from 965 course participants, this paper seeks to understand the factors behind the popularity of these MOOCs. Five factors were found. These include the following, ranked in terms of importance: (1) problem-centric learning with clear expositions, (2) instructor accessibility and passion, (3) active learning, (4) peer interaction, and (5) using helpful course resources. The specific design strategies pertaining to each factor are further discussed in this paper. These strategies can provide useful guidance for instructors and are a worthwhile subject for further experimental validation.},

ILEs need to function in real educational settings (e.g., schools) in which a number of goals interact. Several instructional design methodologies exist to help de- velopers address these goals. However, they often lead to conflicting recommendations. Due to the lack of an estab- lished methodology to resolve such conflicts, developers of ILEs have to rely on ad-hoc solutions. We present a princi- pled methodology to resolve such conflicts. We build on a well-established design process for creating Cognitive Tu- tors, a highly effective type of ILE. We extend this process by integrating methods from multiple disciplines to resolve design conflicts. We illustrate our methodology's effective- ness by describing the iterative development of the Fractions Tutor, which has proven to be effective in classroom studies with 3,000 4th-6th graders.},

Yet, little is known about the effectiveness of these online courses in engaging participants in the learning process. This study explores the range of pedagogical tools used in 24 MOOCs, including the epistemological and social dimensions of instruction, to consider the extent to which these courses provide students with high-quality, collaborative learning experiences. Findings suggest that the range of pedagogical practices currently used in MOOCs tends toward an objectivist-individual approach, with some efforts to incorporate more constructivist and group-oriented approaches. By examining MOOCs through the lens of engaged teaching and learning, this study raises concerns about the degree to which MOOCs are actually revolutionizing higher education by using technology to improve quality, and challenges educators to strive for more creative and empowering forms of open online learning. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Unlike earlier classifications of distance education based on the technology used, this analysis focuses on the pedagogy that defines the learning experiences encapsulated in the learning design. The three generations of cognitive-behaviourist, social constructivist, and connectivist pedagogy are examined, using the familiar community of inquiry model (Garrison, Anderson, {\&} Archer, 2000) with its focus on social, cognitive, and teaching presences. Although this typology of pedagogies could also be usefully applied to campus-based education, the need for and practice of openness and explicitness in distance education content and process makes the work especially relevant to distance education designers, teachers, and developers. The article concludes that high-quality distance education exploits all three generations as determined by the learning content, context, and learning expectations.},

abstract = {When you share content in an online social network, who is listening? Users have scarce information about who actually sees their content, making their audience seem invisible and difficult to estimate. However, understanding this invisible audience can impact both science and design, since perceived audiences influence content production and self-presentation online. In this paper, we combine survey and large-scale log data to examine how well users' perceptions of their audience match their actual audience on Facebook. We find that social media users consistently underestimate their audience size for their posts, guessing that their audience is just 27{\%} of its true size. Qualitative coding of survey responses reveals folk theories that attempt to reverse-engineer audience size using feedback and friend count, though none of these approaches are particularly accurate. We analyze audience logs for 222,000 Facebook users' posts over the course of one month and find that publicly visible signals — friend count, likes, and comments — vary widely and do not strongly indicate the audience of a single post. Despite the variation, users typically reach 61{\%} of their friends each month. Together, our results begin to reveal the invisible undercurrents of audience attention and behavior in online social networks.},

MOOCs differ from other teaching environments in both the potentially “Massive” number of participants and the “Open” aspect of teaching in a public forum.

Using a case study approach and qualitative interview methodology, this study chronicles current practice with an eye toward emergent, effective practice. Whether a collaborative, connectivist cMOOC style or video-lecture based xMOOC style, or something in between, the role of the instructor is largely pedagogical; oriented toward planning and preparing the MOOC experience. As a result, real time, synchronous engagement from MOOC instructors during a course likely has little effect on most participants. Keywords:},

abstract = {We interviewed eight University of Toronto (U of T) instructors who have offered MOOCs on Coursera or EdX between 2012 and 2014 to understand their motivation for MOOC instruction, their experience developing and teaching MOOCs, and their perceptions of the implications of MOOC instruction on their teaching and research practices. Through inductive analysis, we gleaned common motivations for MOOC development, including expanding public access to high quality learning resources, showcasing U of T teaching practices, and attempting to engage MOOC learners in application of concepts learned, even in the face of constraints that may inhibit active learning in MOOC contexts. MOOC design and delivery was a team effort with ample emphasis on planning and clarity. Instructors valued U of T instructional support in promoting systematic MOOC design and facilitating technical issues related to MOOC platforms. The evolution of MOOC support at U of T grew from a focus on addressing technical issues, to instructional design of MOOCs driven, first, by desired learning outcomes. Findings include changes in teaching practices of the MOOC instructors as they revised pedagogical practices in their credit courses by increasing opportunities for active learning and using MOOC resources to subsequently flip their classrooms. This study addresses the paucity of research on faculty experiences with developing MOOCs, which can subsequently inform the design of new forms of MOOC-like initiatives to increase public access to high quality learning resources, including those available through U of T.},

abstract = {Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are among the latest e-learning initiative to attain widespread popularity among many universities. In this paper, a review of the current published literature focusing on the use of MOOCs by instructors or students was conducted. Our primary goal in doing this is to summarize the accumulated state of knowledge concerning the main motivations and challenges of using MOOCs, as well as to identify issues that have yet to be fully addressed or resolved. Our findings suggest four reasons why students sign up for MOOCs: the desire to learn about a new topic or to extend current knowledge, they were curious about MOOCs, for personal challenge, and the desire to collect as many completion certificates as possible. Up to 90{\%} drop out due to reasons including a lack of incentive, failure to understand the content material and having no one to turn to for help, and having other priorities to fulfill. Findings suggest three main reasons why instructors wish to teach MOOCs: being motivated by a sense of intrigue, the desire to gain some personal (egoistic) rewards, or a sense of altruism. Four key challenges of teaching MOOCs are also surfaced: difficulty in evaluating students' work, having a sense of speaking into a vacuum due to the absence of student immediate feedback, being burdened by the heavy demands of time and money, and encountering a lack of student participation in online forums. We conclude by discussing two issues that have yet to be fully resolved - the quality of MOOC education, and the assessment of student work. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

Unfortunately, the same open-ended nature which makes them so valuable also makes them more difficult to grade at scale. To address this, we propose a cluster-based interface that allows teachers to read, grade, and provide feedback on large groups of answers at once. We evaluated this interface against an unclustered baseline in a within-sub- jects study with 25 teachers, and found that the clustered in- terface allows teachers to grade substantially faster, to give more feedback to students, and to develop a high-level view of students' understanding and misconceptions.},

abstract = {Collaborative learning incorporates a social component in distance education to minimize the disadvantages of studying in solitude. Frequent analysis of student interactions is required for assessing collaboration. Collaboration analytics arose as a discipline to study student interactions and to promote active participation in e-learning environments. Unfortunately, researchers have been more focused on finding methods to solve collaboration problems than on explaining the results to tutors and students. Yet if students do not understand the results of collaboration analysis methods, they will rarely follow their advice. In this paper we propose a tool that analyzes student interactions and visually explains the collaboration circumstances to provoke the self-reflection and promote the sensemaking about collaboration. The tool presents a visual explanatory decision tree that graphically highlights student collaboration circumstances and helps to understand the reasoning followed by the tool when prescribing a recommendation. An assessment of the tool has demonstrated: (1) the students collaboration circumstances showed by the tool are easy to understand and (2) the students could realize the possible actions to improve the collaboration process.},

abstract = {Dealing with tens of thousands of homework submissions (particularly open- ended ones) remains a challenge in the online classroom. In massive open online courses where the student-teacher ratio can be ten thousand to one or worse, it is impossible for instructors to personally give feedback to students or to understand the multitude of approaches taken, and pitfalls encountered by their students. Organizing and making sense of massive collections of homework solutions is thus a critical web problem that must be solved, as more people around the globe turn to online education and expect quality instruction. Despite the challenges, the dense sampling over the solution space in highly structured homeworks that exists for some MOOCs suggests an elegant solution to providing high quality feedback to students on a massive scale. We outline a novel way to decompose online homework submissions into a vocabulary of “code phrases”, and based on this vocabulary, we architect a queryable index that allows fast searches into the massive dataset of student homework submissions. To demonstrate the utility of our homework search engine we index over a million code submissions from users worldwide in Stanford's Machine Learning massive open online course (MOOC) and then (a) semi-automatically learn shared structure amongst homework submissions and (b) generate specific feedback for student mistakes.},

abstract = {The Online Course Tool for Adaptive Learning (OCTAL) is a tool that combines an exercise system with a concept map to allow learners to explore an underlying prerequisite structure of topics. An algorithm that estimates a learner's level of mastery highlights concepts in the graph to provide the user with a metacognitive hint about their progress through the material. Learners are guided by the prerequisite structure and knowledge inference but may navigate freely through the graph. We intend OCTAL to be a formative assessment tool that is not tied to any specific course or subject and provide authoring tools for content designers to create material. Toward the goal of being usable in a number of online courses, OCTAL has support to be embedded within online learning platforms such as edX. Students enroll in online courses with different learning goals and, as a result, may wish to pursue their own paths through the material. OCTAL presents the underlying prerequisite structure of the material to allow learners the opportunity to decide whether or not deviation from the expert-defined path would be beneficial for their understanding. This allows students to metacognitively consider their level of mastery in a course's advanced concepts by exploring exercises without limitation and may therefore be useful to help answer the question "will this course be useful?" Similarly, for those students enrolled in a course, it allows them to decide how to prioritize consumption of content and discover which concepts they may reasonably skip, if necessary. In order to study the benefits of metacognition with OCTAL, we authored a concept map and question set for topics from UC Berkeley's CS10: The Beauty and Joy of Computing. We presented the tool to the students of the course between their first and second midterm exams during the spring of 2014. In the study, we found no statistically significant changes in metacognition among participants who used the tool. However, analysis of participant usage of the tool reveals differences in the way learners approach concepts presented to them in a list versus in a graph. In particular, while users often followed a list of concepts in-order, learners that navigated a graph explored concepts in clusters.},

EDM researchers are addressing questions of cognition, metacognition, motivation, affect, language, social discourse, etc. using data from intelligent tutoring systems, massive open online courses, educational games and simulations, and discussion forums. The data include detailed action and timing logs of student interactions in user interfaces such as graded responses to questions or essays, steps in rich problem solving environments, games or simulations, discussion forum posts, or chat dialogs. They might also include external sensors such as eye tracking, facial expression, body movement, etc. We review how EDM has addressed the research questions that surround the psychology of learning with an emphasis on assessment, transfer of learning and model discovery, the role of affect, motivation and metacognition on learning, and analysis of language data and collaborative learning. For example, we discuss (1) how different statistical assessment methods were used in a data mining competition to improve prediction of student responses to intelligent tutor tasks, (2) how better cognitive models can be discovered from data and used to improve instruction, (3) how data-driven models of student affect can be used to focus discussion in a dialog-based tutoring system, and (4) how machine learning techniques applied to discussion data can be used to produce automated agents that support student learning as they collaborate in a chat room or a discussion board.},

However, this inter- nal metric does not necessarily translate into ef- fective clustering from the user's perspective. This work presents the interactive Bayesian Case Model (iBCM), a model that opens a communi- cation channel between the clustering model and the user. Users can provide direct input to iBCM in order to achieve effective clustering results, and iBCM optimizes the clustering by creating a balance between what the data indicate and what makes the most sense to the user. This model provides feedback for users and does not assume any prior knowledge of machine learning on their part. We provide quantitative evidence that users are able to obtain more satisfactory clustering results through iBCM than without an interac- tive model. We also demonstrate the use of this method in a real-world setting where computer language class teachers utilize iBCM to cluster students' coding assignments for grading.},

Students are given time to reflect and write the "muddiest" (least clear) point on an index card, to hand in as they leave class. This practice of assigning end-of-lecture reflection tasks to generate explicit student feedback is well suited for adaptation to the challenge of supporting feedback in online video lectures. We describe the design and evaluation of Mudslide, a prototype system that translates the practice of muddy cards into the realm of online lecture videos. Based on an in-lab study of students and teachers, we find that spatially contextualizing students' muddy point feedback with respect to particular lecture slides is advantageous to both students and teachers. We also reflect on further opportunities for enhancing this feedback method based on teachers' and students' experiences with our prototype.},

abstract = {While MOOCs undoubtedly provide valuable learning resources for students, little research in the MOOC context has sought to evaluate students' learning gains in the environment. It has been long acknowledged that conversation is a significant way for students to construct knowledge and learn. However, rather than studying learning in MOOC discussion forums, the thrust of current research in that context has been to identify factors that predict dropout. Thus, cognitively relevant student behavior in the forums has not been evaluated for its impact on cognitive processes and learning. In this paper, we adopt a content analysis approach to analyze students' cognitively relevant behaviors in a MOOC discussion forum and further explore the relationship between the quantity and quality of that participation with their learning gains. As an integral part of our approach, we built a computational model to automate the analysis so that it is possible to extend the content analysis to all communication that occurred in the MOOC. We identified significant associations between discourse behavior and learning. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

abstract = {With large student enrollment, MOOC instructors face the unique challenge in deciding when to intervene in forum discussions with their limited bandwidth. We study this problem of instructor intervention. Using a large sample of forum data culled from 61 courses, we design a binary classifier to predict whether an instructor should intervene in a discussion thread or not. By incorporating novel information about a forum's type into the classification process, we improve significantly over the previous state-of-the-art. We show how difficult this decision problem is in the real world by validating against indicative human judgment, and empirically show the problem's sensitivity to instructors' intervention preferences. We conclude this paper with our take on the future research issues in intervention.},

abstract = {An efficient peer grading mechanism is proposed for grading the multitude of assignments in online courses. This novel approach is based on game theory and mechanism design. A set of assumptions and a mathematical model is ratified to simulate the dominant strategy behavior of students in a given mechanism. A benchmark function accounting for grade accuracy and workload is established to quantitatively compare effectiveness and scalability of various mechanisms. After multiple iterations of mechanisms under increasingly realistic assumptions, three are proposed: Calibration, Improved Calibration, and Deduction. The Calibration mechanism performs as predicted by game theory when tested in an online crowd-sourced experiment, but fails when students are assumed to communicate. The Improved Calibration mechanism addresses this assumption, but at the cost of more effort spent grading. The Deduction mechanism performs relatively well in the benchmark, outperforming the Calibration, Improved Calibration, traditional automated, and traditional peer grading systems. The mathematical model and benchmark opens the way for future derivative works to be performed and compared.},

abstract = {Massive open online courses (MOOCs) rely primarily on dis- cussion forums for interaction among students. We inves- tigate how forum design affects student activity and learn- ing outcomes through a field experiment with 1101 partici- pants on the edX platform. We introduce a reputation sys- tem, which gives students points for making useful posts. We show that, as in other settings, use of forums in MOOCs is correlated with better grades and higher retention. Reputation systems additionally produce faster response times and larger numbers of responses per post, as well as differences in how students ask questions. However, reputation systems have no significant impact on grades, retention, or the students' sub- jective sense of community. This suggests that forums are es- sential for MOOCs, and reputation systems can improve the forum experience, but other techniques are needed to improve student outcomes and community formation. We also give a set of guidelines for running field experiments on MOOCs.},

The price of anarchy can be high due to undersupply problems, but with certain network topologies it has better bounds. With a pay-ment scheme the game can always implement the social optimum in the best case by giving servers incentive to replicate.},

abstract = {For decades, researchers have debated the pros and cons of adaptive user interfaces with enthusiastic AI practition- ers often confronting skeptical HCI experts (Shneiderman{\&} Maes, 1997). This paper summarizes the SUPPLE projects six years of work analyzing the characteristics of successful adaptive interfaces and developing efficient algorithms for their automatic generation (Gajos {\&} Weld, 2004; Gajos et al., 2005; Gajos {\&} Weld, 2005; Gajos et al., 2006; Gajos, Wobbrock, {\&} Weld, 2007; Gajos et al., 2008; Gajos, Wob- brock, {\&}Weld, 2008). We conclude that personalized user interfaces, which are adapted to a persons devices, tasks, preferences and abili- ties, can improve user satisfaction and performance. Further, we demonstrate that automatic generation of these interfaces is computationally feasible. We developed two systems which autonomously con- struct a broad range of personalized adaptive interfaces: 1) SUPPLE/ARNAULD uses decision-theoretic optimization to automatically generate user interfaces adapted to target de- vice, usage patterns, and a learned model of user prefer- ences, and 2) SUPPLE++ first performs a one-time assess- ment of a persons motor abilities and then automatically generates user interfaces adapted to that users abilities. Our experiments show that these automatically generated interfaces significantly improve speed, accuracy and satis- faction of users with motor impairments compared to man- ufacturers defaults. We also provide the first characterization of the design space of adaptive interfaces and demonstrate how such in- terfaces can significantly improve the quality and efficiency of daily interactions for typical users},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to provide non-specialist readers with an introduc- tion to some current controversies surrounding the application of evolutionary theory to human behaviour at the intersection of biology, psychology and anthropology.We review the three major contemporary sub-fields; namely Human Behavioural Ecol- ogy, Evolutionary Psychology and Cultural Evolution, and we compare their views on maladaptive behaviour, the proximal mechanisms of cultural transmission, and the relationship between human cognition and culture. For example, we show that the sub-fields vary in the amount of maladaptive behaviour that is predicted to occur in modern environments; Human Behavioural Ecologists start with the expectation that behaviour will be optimal, while Evolutionary Psychologists emphasize cases of ‘mis-match' between modern environments and domain-specific, evolved psycho- logical mechanisms. Cultural Evolutionists argue that social learning processes are effective at providing solutions to novel problems and describe how relatively weak, general-purpose learning mechanisms, alongside accurate cultural transmission, can lead to the cumulative evolution of adaptive cultural complexity but also sometimes to maladaptative behaviour. We then describe how the sub-fields view cooperative behaviour between non-kin, as an example of where the differences between the sub- fields are relevant to the economics community, and we discuss the hypothesis that a history of inter-group competition can explain the evolution of non-kin cooperation. We conclude that a complete understanding of human behaviour requires insights from all three fields and that many scholars no longer view them as distinct.},

abstract = {Evolutionary game theory has shown that human cooperation thrives in different types of social interactions with a PD structure. Models treat the cooperative strategies within the different frameworks as discrete entities and sometimes even as contenders. Whereas strong reciprocity was acclaimed as superior to classic reciprocity for its ability to defeat defectors in public goods games, recent experiments and simulations show that costly punishment fails to promote cooperation in the IR and DR games, where classic reciprocity succeeds. My aim is to show that cooperative strategies across frameworks are capable of a unified treatment, for they are governed by a common underlying rule or norm. An analysis of the reputation and action rules that govern some representative cooperative strategies both in models and in economic experiments confirms that the different frameworks share a conditional action rule and several reputation rules. The common conditional rule contains an option between costly punishment and withholding benefits that provides alternative enforcement methods against defectors. Depending on the framework, individuals can switch to the appropriate strategy and method of enforcement. The stability of human cooperation looks more promising if one mechanism controls successful strategies across frameworks. ?? 2010.},

@article{Dasgupta2006,
abstract = {This text, extensively class-tested over a decade at UC Berkeley and UC San Diego, explains the fundamentals of algorithms in a story line that makes the material enjoyable and easy to digest. Emphasis is placed on understanding the crisp mathematical idea behind each algorithm, in a manner that is intuitive and rigorous without being unduly formal. Features include: The use of boxes to strengthen the narrative: pieces that provide historical context, descriptions of how the algorithms are used in practice, and excursions for the mathematically sophisticated. Carefully chosen advanced topics that can be skipped in a standard one-semester course, but can be covered in an advanced algorithms course or in a more leisurely two-semester sequence. An accessible treatment of linear programming introduces students to one of the greatest achievements in algorithms. An optional chapter on the quantum algorithm for factoring provides a unique peephole into this exciting topic. In addition to the text, DasGupta also offers a Solutions Manual, which is available on the Online Learning Center. "Algorithms is an outstanding undergraduate text, equally informed by the historical roots and contemporary applications of its subject. Like a captivating novel, it is a joy to read."

However, one aspect of incentivizing that has been understudied is its impact on participation bias, as different incentives may attract different subsets of the population to participate. In this paper, we present two empirical studies in the crowdworking context that show that the incentive offered influence who participates in the task. Using the Basic Human Values, we found that a lottery reward attracted participants who held stronger openness-to-change values while a charity reward attracted those with stronger selftranscendence orientation. Further, we found that participation self-selection resulted in differences in the task outcomes. Through attracting more self-directed individuals, the lottery reward resulted in more ideas generated in a brainstorming task. Design implications include utilizing rewards to target desired participants and using diverse incentives to improve participation diversity.},

@article{Ghosh2013,
abstract = {We present a game-theoretic model for online forums for education, where students in a class can post questions to the forum and seek responses from the instructor or other students in the class. We first show that our model predicts the anecdotally observed phenomenon that students' participation in a forum is non-monotone in the instructor's response rate to questions: if the instructor responds at too high a rate students do not respond to their peers' questions, whereas an almost-absent instructor induces very little participation from the students as well. We then investigate the optimal use of a forum for two kinds of questions- single-answer questions and discussion-style questions- which lead to different levels of rewards that can be meaningfully offered. We show that for discussion-style questions, the instructor can choose her response rate so that the expected rate at which the first student response is received increases linearly with the size of the class; for single-answer questions, however, the optimal expected rate of arrival of the first student response remains a constant even as class size diverges. However, this slow response rate can be remedied by mixing question types- as long as there is any positive probability of a discussion-type question in a forum, the instructor can choose her response rate so that the equilibrium rate of the first response from the class diverges with the number of students in the class.

abstract = {A challenge with the programmatic access of human talent via crowdsourcing platforms is the speciﬁcation of incentives and the checking of the quality of contributions. Methodolo- gies for checking quality include providing a payment if the work is approved by the task owner and hiring additional workers to evaluate contributors' work. Both of these ap- proaches place a burden on people and on the organizations commissioning tasks, and may be susceptible to manipula- tion by workers and task owners. Moreover, neither a task owner nor the task market may know the task well enough to be able to evaluate worker reports. Methodologies for incentivizing workers without external quality checking include rewards based on agreement with a peer worker or with the ﬁnal output of the system. These approaches are vulner- able to strategic manipulations by workers. Recent experi- ments on Mechanical Turk have demonstrated the negative inﬂuence of manipulations by workers and task owners on crowdsourcing systems [3]. We address this central challenge by introducing incentive mechanisms that promote truth- ful reporting in crowdsourcing and discourage manipulation by workers and task owners without introducing additional overhead.},

abstract = {Peer grading systems work well only if users have incentives to grade truthfully. An example of non-truthful grading, that we observed in classrooms, consists in students assigning the maximum grade to all submissions. With a naive grading scheme, such as averaging the assigned grades, all students would receive the maximum grade. In this paper, we develop three grading schemes that provide incentives for truthful peer grading. In the first scheme, the instructor grades a fraction p of the submissions, and penalizes students whose grade deviates from the instructor grade. We provide lower bounds on p to ensure truthfulness, and conclude that these schemes work only for moderate class sizes, up to a few hundred students. To overcome this limitation, we propose a hierarchical extension of this supervised scheme, and we show that it can handle classes of any size with bounded (and little) instructor work, and is therefore applicable to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Finally, we propose unsupervised incentive schemes, in which the student incentive is based on statistical properties of the grade distribution, without any grading required by the instructor. We show that the proposed unsupervised schemes provide incentives to truthful grading, at the price of being possibly unfair to individual students.},

Market design involves a responsibility for detail, a need to deal with all of a market's complications, not just its principle features. Designers therefore cannot work only with the simple conceptual models used for theoretical insights into the general working of markets. Instead, market design calls for an engineering approach. Drawing primarily on the design of the entry level labor market for American doctors (the National Resident Matching Program), and of the auctions of radio spectrum conducted by the Federal Communications Commission, this paper makes the case that experimental and computational economics are natural complements to game theory in the work of design. The paper also argues that some of the challenges facing both markets involve dealing with related kinds of complementarities, and that this suggests an agenda for future theoretical research.},

Starting an online community is challenging because there is not enough content to attract a critical mass of active members. This paper examines methods for addressing this cold-start problem in datamining-bootstrappable communities by attracting non-members to contribute to the community. We make four contributions: 1) we characterize a set of communities that are “datamining-bootstrappable” and define the bootstrapping problem in terms of decision-theoretic optimization, 2) we estimate the model parameters in a case study involving the Open AI Resources website, 3) we demonstrate that non-members' predicted interest levels and request design are important features that can significantly affect the contribution rate, and 4) we ran a simulation experiment using data generated with the learned parameters and show that our decision-theoretic optimization algorithm can generate as much community utility when bootstrapping the community as our strongest baseline while issuing only 55{\%} as many contribution requests.},

The theory of games, first developed to analyse economic behaviour, is modified so that it can be applied to evolving populations. John Maynard Smith's concept of an evolutionarily stable strategy is relevant whenever the best thing for an animal or plant to do depends on what others are doing. The theory leads to testable predictions about the evolution of behaviour, of sex and genetic systems, and of growth and life history patterns. This book contains the first full account of the theory, and of the data relevant to it. The account is aimed at senior undergraduate and graduate students, teachers and research workers in animal behaviour, population genetics and evolutionary biology. The book will also be of interest to mathematicians and game theorists; the mathematics has been largely confined to appendixes so that the main text may be easily followed by biologists.},

abstract = {AsMOOCs grow in popularity, the relatively low completion rates of learners has been a central criticism. This focus on completion rates, however, reflects a monolithic view of dis- engagement that does not allow MOOC designers to target interventions or develop adaptive course features for particu- lar subpopulations of learners. To address this, we present a simple, scalable, and informative classification method that identifies a small number of longitudinal engagement tra- jectories in MOOCs. Learners are classified based on their patterns of interaction with video lectures and assessments, the primary features of most MOOCs to date. In an analysis of three computer science MOOCs, the classifier consistently identifies four prototypical trajectories of engagement. The most notable of these is the learners who stay engaged through the course without taking assess- ments. These trajectories are also a useful framework for the comparison of learner engagement between different course structures or instructional approaches. We compare learners in each trajectory and course across demographics, forum participation, video access, and reports of overall experi- ence. These results inform a discussion of future interven- tions, research, and design directions for MOOCs. Poten- tial improvements to the classification mechanism are also discussed, including the introduction of more fine-grained analytics.},

abstract = {Constructing a good conference schedule for a large multi-track conference needs to take into account the preferences and constraints of organizers, authors, and attendees. Creating a schedule which has fewer conflicts for authors and attendees, and thematically coherent sessions is a challenging task. Cobi introduced an alternative approach to conference scheduling by engaging the community to play an active role in the planning process. The current Cobi pipeline consists of committee-sourcing and author-sourcing to plan a conference schedule. We further explore the design space of community-sourcing by introducing attendee-sourcing -- a process that collects input from conference attendees and encodes them as preferences and constraints for creating sessions and schedule. For CHI 2014, a large multi-track conference in human-computer interaction with more than 3,000 attendees and 1,000 authors, we collected attendees{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}} preferences by making available all the accepted papers at the conference on a paper recommendation tool we built called Confer, for a period of 45 days before announcing the conference program (sessions and schedule). We compare the preferences marked on Confer with the preferences collected from Cobi{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s author-sourcing approach. We show that attendee-sourcing can provide insights beyond what can be discovered by author-sourcing. For CHI 2014, the results show value in the method and attendees{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}} participation. It produces data that provides more alternatives in scheduling and complements data collected from other methods for creating coherent sessions and reducing conflicts.},

The cognitive-behavioral model of PIU distinguishes between specific PIU and generalized PIU. Specific PIU refers to the condition in which an individual pathologically uses the Internet for a particular purpose, such as online sex or online gambling, whereas generalized PIU describes a more global set of behaviors. The model implies a more important role of cognitions in PIU, and describes the means by which PIU is both developed and maintained. Furthermore, it provides a framework for the development of cognitive-behavioral interventions for PIU.},

abstract = {The new psychological disorder of Internet addiction is fast accruing both popular and pro- fessional recognition. Past studies have indicated that some patterns of Internet use are associated with loneliness, shyness, anxiety, depression, and self-consciousness, but there appears to be little consensus about Internet addiction disorder. This exploratory study attempted to examine the potential influences of personality variables, such as shyness and locus of control, online experiences, and demographics on Internet addiction. Data were gathered from a convenient sample using a combination of online and offline methods. The respondents comprised 722 Internet users mostly from the Net-generation. Results indicated that the higher the tendency of one being addicted to the Internet, the shyer the person is, the less faith the person has, the firmer belief the person holds in the irresistible power of others, and the higher trust the person places on chance in determining his or her own course of life. People who are addicted to the Internet make intense and frequent use of it both in terms of days per week and in length of each session, especially for online communication via e-mail, ICQ, chat rooms, newsgroups, and online games. Furthermore, full-time students are more likely to be addicted to the Internet, as they are considered high-risk for problems because of free and unlimited access and flexible time schedules. Implications to help professionals and student affairs policy makers are addressed.},

That famous paper and Lindblom's related work also provided two theories: a critique of the conventional method (the synoptic approach) and an argument for using incrementalism instead. Both are applied theories: they are designed to help solve complex policy problems. Lindblom's negative applied theory has stood the test of time well: the empirical foundations of its main micro-component (cognitive constraints of individuals) and its central macro-component (the impact of preference conflict on policy making) have grown stronger since 1959. The picture regarding the positive applied theory is more mixed. As a coherent decision-making strategy, disjointed incrementalism has almost disappeared. Yet its key elements, the major heuristics identified in 'Muddling Through,' are thriving in many applied fields. Intriguingly, they are often accompanied by subroutines-especially optimization as a choice rule-typically associated with the synoptic approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Emerging online ideation platforms with thousands of example ideas provide an important resource for creative production. But how can ideators best use these examples to create new innovations? Recent work has suggested that not just the choice of examples, but also the timing of their delivery can impact creative outcomes. Building on existing cognitive theories of creative insight, we hypothesize that people are likely to benefit from examples when they run out of ideas. We explore two example delivery mechanisms that test this hypothesis: 1) a system that proactively provides examples when a user appears to have run out of ideas, and 2) a system that provides examples when a user explicitly requests them. Our online experiment (N=97) compared these two mechanisms against two baselines: providing no examples and automatically showing examples at a regular interval. Participants who requested examples themselves generated ideas that were rated the most novel by external evaluators. Participants who received ideas automatically when they appeared to be stuck produced the most ideas. Importantly, participants who received examples at a regular interval generated fewer ideas than participants who received no examples, suggesting that mere access to examples is not sufficient for creative inspiration. These results emphasize the importance of the timing of example delivery. Insights from this study can inform the design of collective ideation support systems that help people generate many high quality ideas.},

For example, many people have thousands of digital photographs that languish in unorganized archives because it is difficult and time consuming to gather them into meaningful collections. Such tasks are hard to start because they seem to require long uninterrupted periods of effort to make meaningful progress. We propose the idea of selfsourcing as a way to help people to perform large personal information tasks by breaking them into manageable microtasks. Using ideas from crowdsourcing and task management, selfsourcing can help people take advantage of existing gaps in time and recover quickly from interruptions. We present several achievable self-sourcing scenarios and explore how they can facilitate information work in interruption-driven environments.},

abstract = {Heart disease is the number one killer in the United States, and finding indicators of the disease at an early stage is critical for treatment and prevention. In this paper we evaluate visualization techniques that enable the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. A key physical quantity of medical interest is endothelial shear stress (ESS). Low ESS has been associated with sites of lesion formation and rapid progression of disease in the coronary arteries. Having effective visualizations of a patient's ESS data is vital for the quick and thorough non-invasive evaluation by a cardiologist. We present a task taxonomy for hemodynamics based on a formative user study with domain experts. Based on the results of this study we developed HemoVis, an interactive visualization application for heart disease diagnosis that uses a novel 2D tree diagram representation of coronary artery trees. We present the results of a formal quantitative user study with domain experts that evaluates the effect of 2D versus 3D artery representations and of color maps on identifying regions of low ESS. We show statistically significant results demonstrating that our 2D visualizations are more accurate and efficient than 3D representations, and that a perceptually appropriate color map leads to fewer diagnostic mistakes than a rainbow color map.},

abstract = {Data analysts often build visualizations as the first step in their an-alytical workflow. However, when working with high-dimensional datasets, identifying visualizations that show relevant or desired trends in data can be laborious. We propose SEEDB, a visual-ization recommendation engine to facilitate fast visual analysis: given a subset of data to be studied, SEEDB intelligently explores the space of visualizations, evaluates promising visualizations for trends, and recommends those it deems most " useful " or " inter-esting " . The two major obstacles in recommending interesting vi-sualizations are (a) scale: evaluating a large number of candidate visualizations while responding within interactive time scales, and (b) utility: identifying an appropriate metric for assessing interest-ingness of visualizations. For the former, SEEDB introduces prun-ing optimizations to quickly identify high-utility visualizations and sharing optimizations to maximize sharing of computation across visualizations. For the latter, as a first step, we adopt a deviation-based metric for visualization utility, while indicating how we may be able to generalize it to other factors influencing utility. We im-plement SEEDB as a middleware layer that can run on top of any DBMS. Our experiments show that our framework can identify in-teresting visualizations with high accuracy. Our optimizations lead to multiple orders of magnitude speedup on relational row and col-umn stores and provide recommendations at interactive time scales. Finally, we demonstrate via a user study the effectiveness of our deviation-based utility metric and the value of recommendations in supporting visual analytics.},

Current storytelling tools often structure novice work through templates, enforcing a linear creative process that asks novices for materials they may not have. In this paper, we propose scaffolding creative work using storytelling patterns extracted from stories created by experts. Patterns are modular sets of related camera shots that expert videographers commonly use to achieve a specific narrative function. After identifying a set of patterns from high-quality storytelling videos, we created Motif, a mobile video storytelling application that allows users to construct video stories by combining these patterns. By making existing solutions used by experts available to novices, we encourage capturing shots with story structure and narrative goals in mind. In a controlled study where we asked participants to create travel video stories, videos created with patterns conveyed stronger narrative structure and were considered higher quality by expert evaluators than videos created without patterns.},

abstract = {Epistasis (gene-gene interaction) detection in large-scale genetic association studies has recently drawn extensive research interests as many complex traits are likely caused by the joint effect of multiple genetic factors. The large number of possible interactions poses both statistical and computational challenges. A variety of approaches have been developed to address the analytical challenges in epistatic interaction detection. These methods usually output the identified genetic interactions and store them in flat file formats. It is highly desirable to develop an effective visualization tool to further investigate the detected interactions and unravel hidden interaction patterns. We have developed EINVis, a novel visualization tool that is specifically designed to analyze and explore genetic interactions. EINVis displays interactions among genetic markers as a network. It utilizes a circular layout (specially, a tree ring view) to simultaneously visualize the hierarchical interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genes, and chromosomes, and the network structure formed by these interactions. Using EINVis, the user can distinguish marginal effects from interactions, track interactions involving more than two markers, visualize interactions at different levels, and detect proxy SNPs based on linkage disequilibrium. EINVis is an effective and user-friendly free visualization tool for analyzing and exploring genetic interactions. It is publicly available with detailed documentation and online tutorial on the web at http://filer.case.edu/yxw407/einvis/.},

We chart advances over the past several decades that address challenges of perception and action under uncertainty through the lens of computation. Advances include the development of representations and inferential procedures for large-scale probabilistic inference and machinery for enabling reflection and decisions about tradeoffs in effort, precision, and timeliness of computations. These tools are deployed toward the goal of computational rationality: identifying decisions with highest expected utility, while taking into consideration the costs of computation in complex real-world problems in which most relevant calculations can only be approximated. We highlight key concepts with examples that show the potential for interchange between computer science, cognitive science, and neuroscience.},

abstract = {Due to substantial scientific and practical progress, learning technologies can effectively adapt to the characteristics and needs of students. This article considers how learning technologies can adapt over time by crowdsourcing contributions from teachers and students – explanations, feedback, and other pedagogical interactions. Considering the context of ASSISTments, an online learning platform, we explain how interactive mathematics exercises can provide the workflow necessary for eliciting feedback contributions and evaluating those contributions, by simply tapping into the everyday system usage of teachers and students. We discuss a series of randomized controlled experiments that are currently running within ASSISTments, with the goal of establishing proof of concept that students and teachers can serve as valuable resources for the perpetual improvement of adaptive learning technologies. We also consider how teachers and students can be motivated to provide such contributions, and discuss the plans surrounding PeerASSIST, an infrastructure that will help ASSISTments to harness the power of the crowd. Algorithms from machine learning (i.e., multi-armed bandits) will ideally provide a mechanism for managerial control, allowing for the automatic evaluation of contributions and the personalized provision of the highest quality content. In many ways, the next 25 years of adaptive learning technologies will be driven by the crowd, and this article serves as the road map that ASSISTments has chosen to follow.},

abstract = {Online crowds are a promising source of new innovations. However, crowd innovation quality does not always match its quantity. In this paper, we explore how to improve crowd innovation with real-time expert guidance. One approach would for experts to provide personalized feed-back, but this scales poorly, and may lead to premature convergence during creative work. Drawing on strategies for facilitating face-to-face brainstorms, we introduce a crowd ideation system where experts monitor incoming ideas through a dashboard and offer high-level "inspira-tions" to guide ideation. A series of controlled experiments show that experienced facilitators increased the quantity and creativity of workers' ideas compared to unfacilitated workers, while Novice facilitators reduced workers' crea-tivity. Analyses of inspiration strategies suggest these opposing results stem from differential use of successful inspiration strategies (e.g., provoking mental simulations). The results show that expert facilitation can significantly improve crowd innovation, but inexperienced facilitators may need scaffolding to be successful.},

Large-scale microbial metagenomics studies have particularly exciting applications in the arena of human health, laying the foundation for the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). In the context of the HMP and related efforts, care has been taken to understand the impact of amplification biases or sequencing errors. However, far less attention has been paid to the impact of errors in metadata on biological interpretations and the mitigation of such errors. During processing and pooling of hundreds of samples, some mislabeling is likely. Figure 1 illustrates a real world example: several 16S rRNA amplifications of bacterial community DNA samples collected along a time series were accidentally mislabeled (late switched to early) (Koenig et al., 2010). Automated detection of such errors will be important as datasets become increasingly large and complex.},

abstract = {People complete tasks more quickly when they have concrete plans. However, they often fail to create such action plans. (How) can systems provide these concrete steps automatically? This article demonstrates that these benefits can also be realized when these plans are created by others or reused from similar tasks. Four experiments test these approaches, finding that people indeed complete more tasks when they receive externally-created action plans. To automatically provide plans, we introduce the Genies workflow that combines benefits of crowd wisdom, collaborative refinement, and automation. We demonstrate and evaluate this approach through the TaskGenies system, and introduce an NLP similarity algorithm for reusing plans. We demonstrate that it is possible for people to create action plans for others, and we show that it can be cost effective. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM 1073-0516/2013/11-ART27 {\$}15.00.},

abstract = {In the United States, humans spend the majority of their time indoors, where they are exposed to the microbiome of the built environment (BE) they inhabit. Despite the ubiquity of microbes in BEs and their potential impacts on health and building materials, basic questions about the microbiology of these environments remain unanswered. We present a study on the impacts of geography, material type, human interaction, location in a room, seasonal variation, and indoor and microenvironmental parameters on bacterial communities in offices. Our data elucidate several important features of microbial communities in BEs. First, under normal office environmental conditions, bacterial communities do not differ on the basis of surface material (e.g., ceiling tile or carpet) but do differ on the basis of the location in a room (e.g., ceiling or floor), two features that are often conflated but that we are able to separate here. We suspect that previous work showing differences in bacterial composition with surface material was likely detecting differences based on different usage patterns. Next, we find that offices have city-specific bacterial communities, such that we can accurately predict which city an office microbiome sample is derived from, but office-specific bacterial communities are less apparent. This differs from previous work, which has suggested office-specific compositions of bacterial communities. We again suspect that the difference from prior work arises from different usage patterns. As has been previously shown, we observe that human skin contributes heavily to the composition of BE surfaces.},

abstract = {Millions of learners today arewatching videos on online platforms, such as Khan Academy, YouTube, Coursera, and edX, to take courses and master new skills. But existing video interfaces are not designed to support learning, with limited interactivity and lack of in- formation about learners' engagement and content. Making these improvements requires deep semantic information about video that even state-of-the-art AI techniques cannot fully extract. I take a data-driven approach to address this challenge, using large-scale learning interaction data to dynamically improve video content and interfaces. Specifically, this thesis introduces learnersourcing, a form of crowdsourcing in which learners collectively contribute novel content for future learners while engaging in a meaningful learning expe- rience themselves. I present learnersourcing applications designed for massive open online course videos and how-to tutorial videos, where learners' collective activities 1) highlight points of confusion or importance in a video, 2) extract a solution structure from a tutorial, and 3) improve the navigation experience for future learners. This thesis demonstrates how learnersourcing can enable more interactive, collaborative, and data-driven learning.},

abstract = {We introduce here a new method for computing differences between microbial communities based on phylogenetic information. This method, UniFrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to determine whether communities are signifi- cantly different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities between samples. We demonstrate the utility of UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice. Our results reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the Arctic and Antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater samples are not more similar to each other than to those in sediment or ice samples. These results illustrate that UniFrac provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth of environmental rRNA sequences, and allows quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among environments.},

A major goal of these studies is the identification of important groups of microorganisms that vary according to physiological or disease states in the host, but the incidence of rare taxa and the large numbers of taxa observed make that goal difficult to obtain using traditional approaches. Fortunately, similar problems have been addressed by the machine learning community in other fields of study such as microarray analysis and text classification. In this review, we demonstrate that several existing supervised classifiers can be applied effectively to microbiota classification, both for selecting subsets of taxa that are highly discriminative of the type of community, and for building models that can accurately classify unlabeled data. To encourage the development of new approaches to supervised classification of microbiota, we discuss several structures inherent in microbial community data that may be available for exploitation in novel approaches, and we include as supplemental information several benchmark classification tasks for use by the community.},

More importantly, it may contribute to a wide variety of diseases, including cancer, inflammatory diseases, metabolic diseases and responses to pathogens. We expect that international, integrative and interdiscipli‐ nary translational research teams, along with the emer‐ gence of FDA-approved platforms, will set the framework for microbiome-based therapeutics and diagnostics. We recognize that the microbiome ecosystem offers new promise for personalized/precision medicine and targeted treatment for a variety of diseases. The short course was held as a four-session webinar series in April 2015, taught by pioneers and experts in the microbiome ecosystem, covering a broad range of topics from the healthy microbiome to the effects of an altered microbiome from neonates to adults and the long term effects as it is related to disease, from asthma to cancer. We have learned to appreciate how beneficial our microbes are in breaking down our food, fighting off infections and nurturing our immune system, and this information provides us with ideas as to how we can manipulate our microbiome to prevent certain diseases. However, given the variety of applications, there are scientific challenges, though there are very promising areas in reference to the clinical benefits of understanding more about our micro‐ biome, whether in our gut or on our skin: the outlook is bright.

abstract = {The role of the human microbiome is the subject of continued investigation resulting in increased understanding. However, current microbiome research has only scratched the surface of the variety of healthy microbiomes. Public participation in science through crowdsourcing and crowdfunding microbiome research provides a novel opportunity for both participants and investigators. However, turning participatory science into publishable data can be challenging. Clear communication with the participant base and among researchers can ameliorate some challenges. Three major aspects need to be considered: recruitment and ongoing interaction, sample collection, and data analysis. Usable data can be maximized through diligent participant interaction, careful survey design, and maintaining an open source pipeline. While participatory science will complement rather than replace traditional avenues, it presents new opportunities for studies in the microbiome and beyond.},

abstract = {The human gut harbours diverse and abundant microbes, forming a complex ecological system that interacts with host and environmental factors. In this article, we summarise recent advances in microbiome studies across both Western and non-Western populations, either in cross-sectional or longitudinal surveys, and over various age groups, revealing a considerable diversity and variability in the human gut microbiome. Of all the exogenous factors affecting gut microbiome, a long-term diet appears to have the largest effect to date. Recent research on the effects of dietary interventions has shown that the gut microbiome can change dramatically with diet; however, the gut microbiome is generally resilient, and short-term dietary intervention is not typically successful in treating obesity and malnutrition. Understanding the dynamics of the gut microbiome under different conditions will help us diagnose and treat many diseases that are now known to be associated with microbial communities.},

In this paper, we quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate an efficient, accurate and scalable feature-compression method us- ing latent Dirichlet allocation for discrete data. This representation can effectively communicate the charac- teristics of high-dimensional, complex data points. We show that the improvement of a user's interpretability through the use of a topic modeling-based compres- sion technique is statistically significant, according to a number of metrics, when compared with other repre- sentations. Also, we find that this representation is scal- able — it maintains alignment with human classifica- tion accuracy as an increasing number of data points are shown. In addition, the learned topic layer can semanti- cally deliver meaningful information to users that could potentially aid human reasoning about data characteris- tics in connection with compressed topic space.},

abstract = {Decades of research have repeatedly shown that people perform poorly at estimating and understanding conditional probabilities that are inherent in Bayesian reasoning problems. Yet in the medical domain, both physicians and patients make daily, life-critical judgments based on conditional probability. Although there have been a number of attempts to develop more effective ways to facilitate Bayesian reasoning, reports of these findings tend to be inconsistent and sometimes even contradictory. For instance, the reported accuracies for individuals being able to correctly estimate conditional probability range from 6{\%} to 62{\%}. In this work, we show that problem representation can significantly affect accuracies. By controlling the amount of information presented to the user, we demonstrate how text and visualization designs can increase overall accuracies to as high as 77{\%}. Additionally, we found that for users with high spatial ability, our designs can further improve their accuracies to as high as 100{\%}. By and large, our findings provide explanations for the inconsistent reports on accuracy in Bayesian reasoning tasks and show a significant improvement over existing methods. We believe that these findings can have immediate impact on risk communication in health-related fields},

@article{Kim2015,
abstract = {I envision a system that enables successful collaborations between humans and machine learning models by harnessing the relative strength to accomplish what neither can do alone. Machine learning techniques and humans have skills that complement each other — machine learning techniques are good at computation on data at the lowest level of granularity, whereas people are better at abstracting knowledge from their experience, and transferring the knowledge across domains. The goal of this thesis is to develop a framework for human-in-the-loop machine learning that enables people to interact effectively with machine learning models to make better decisions, without requiring in-depth knowledge about machine learning techniques. Many of us interact with machine learning systems everyday. Systems that mine data for product recommendations, for example, are ubiquitous. However these systems compute their output without end-user involvement, and there are typically no life or death consequences in the case the machine learning result is not acceptable to the user. In contrast, domains where decisions can have serious consequences (e.g., emergency response panning, medical decision-making), require the incorporation of human experts' domain knowledge. These systems also must be transparent to earn experts' trust and be adopted in their workflow. The challenge addressed in this thesis is that traditional machine learning systems are not designed to extract domain experts' knowledge from natural workflow, or to provide pathways for the human domain expert to directly interact with the algorithm to interject their knowledge or to better understand the system output. For machine learning systems to make a real-world impact in these important domains, these systems must be able to communicate with highly skilled human experts to leverage their judgment and expertise, and share useful information or patterns from the data.   In this thesis, I bridge this gap by building human-in-the-loop machine learning models and systems that compute and communicate machine learning results in ways that are compatible with the human decision-making process, and that can readily incorporate human experts' domain knowledge. I start by building a machine learning model that infers human teams' planning decisions from the structured form of natural language of team meetings. I show that the model can infer a human teams' final plan with 86{\%} accuracy on average. I then design an interpretable machine learning model then "makes sense to humans" by exploring and communicating patterns and structure in data to support human decision-making. Through human subject experiments, I show that this interpretable machine learning model offers statistically significant quantitative improvements in interpretability while preserving clustering performance. Finally, I design a machine learning model that supports transparent interaction with humans without requiring that a user has expert knowledge of machine learning technique. I build a human-in-the-loop machine learning system that incorporates human feedback and communicates its internal states to humans, using an intuitive medium for interaction with the machine learning model. I demonstrate the application of this model for an educational domain in which teachers cluster programming assignments to streamline the grading process.

We show that our SNaCK embeddings are useful in several tasks: distinguishing prime and nonprime numbers on MNIST, discovering labeling mistakes in the Caltech UCSD Birds (CUB) dataset with the help of deep-learned features, creating training datasets for bird classifiers, capturing subjective human taste on a new dataset of 10,000 foods, and qualitatively exploring an unstructured set of pictographic characters.

We achieve, depending on algorithm and encoding, between 62{\%} and 83{\%} accuracy at predicting whether each user will be fast or slow at completing the task.

Further analyses show that strong results can be attained with limited observation time: in one case 95{\%} of the final accuracy is gained after a quarter of the average task completion time.

abstract = {Recently, many automatic test generation techniques have been proposed, such as Randoop, Pex and jCUTE. However, usually test coverage of these techniques has been around 50-60{\%} only, due to several challenges, such as 1) the object mutation problem, where test generators cannot create and/or modify test inputs to desired object states; and 2) the constraint solving problem, where test generators fail to solve path conditions to cover certain branches. By analyzing branches not covered by state-of-the-art techniques, we noticed that these challenges might not be so difficult for humans. To verify this hypothesis, we propose a Puzzle-based Automatic Testing environment (PAT) which decomposes object mutation and complex constraint solving problems into small puzzles for humans to solve. We generated PAT puzzles for two open source projects and asked different groups of people to solve these puzzles. It was shown that they could be effectively solved by humans: 231 out of 400 puzzles were solved by humans at an average speed of one minute per puzzle. The 231 puzzle solutions helped cover 534 and 308 additional branches (7.0{\%} and 5.8{\%} coverage improvement) in the two open source projects, on top of the saturated branch coverages achieved by the two state-of-the-art test generation techniques.

abstract = {Analyzing complex textual datasets consists of identifying connections and relationships within the data based on users' intuition and domain expertise. In a spatial workspace, users can do so implicitly by spatially arranging documents into clusters to convey similarity or relationships. Algorithms exist that spatialize and cluster such information mathematically based on similarity metrics. However, analysts often find inconsistencies in these generated clusters based on their expertise. Therefore, to support sensemaking, layouts must be co-created by the user and the model. In this paper, we present the results of a study observing individual users performing a sensemaking task in a spatial workspace. We examine the users' interactions during their analytic process, and also the clusters the users manually created. We found that specific interactions can act as valuable indicators of important structure within a dataset. Further, we analyze and characterize the structure of the user-generated clusters to identify useful metrics to guide future algorithms. Through a deeper understanding of how users spatially cluster information, we can inform the design of interactive algorithms to generate more meaningful spatializations for text analysis tasks, to better respond to user interactions during the analytics process, and ultimately to allow analysts to more rapidly gain insight. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

Consider a researcher who wants to itera-tively build up a set of labels (" codes ") that capture recur-ring themes in free-response data by reading and label-ing portions of text. They can only label as many portions of text as they can read. If the dataset has thousands of free responses, the researcher can never read them all. Machine learning algorithms can train on the researcher's initial labels and propagate those labels to unseen free re-sponses. To help researchers trust these propagated la-bels, the machine learning algorithm's decisions should be interpretable, i.e., understood by the researcher. We believe qualitative researchers working with these large datasets would significantly benefit from data exploration and cod-ing interfaces powered by interpretable machine learning algorithms.},

abstract = {Self-assembling RNA molecules present compelling substrates for the rational interrogation and control of living systems. However, imperfect in silico models--even at the secondary structure level--hinder the design of new RNAs that function properly when synthesized. Here, we present a unique and potentially general approach to such empirical problems: the Massive Open Laboratory. The EteRNA project connects 37,000 enthusiasts to RNA design puzzles through an online interface. Uniquely, EteRNA participants not only manipulate simulated molecules but also control a remote experimental pipeline for high-throughput RNA synthesis and structure mapping. We show herein that the EteRNA community leveraged dozens of cycles of continuous wet laboratory feedback to learn strategies for solving in vitro RNA design problems on which automated methods fail. The top strategies--including several previously unrecognized negative design rules--were distilled by machine learning into an algorithm, EteRNABot. Over a rigorous 1-y testing phase, both the EteRNA community and EteRNABot significantly outperformed prior algorithms in a dozen RNA secondary structure design tests, including the creation of dendrimer-like structures and scaffolds for small molecule sensors. These results show that an online community can carry out large-scale experiments, hypothesis generation, and algorithm design to create practical advances in empirical science.},

The spectacular successes of these trained systems have been among the most notable in all of computing and have generated excitement in health care, nance, energy, and general business. But building them can be challenging, even for computer scien- tists with PhD-level training. If these systems are to have a truly broad impact, building them must become easier. We explore one crucial pain point in the construction of trained systems: feature engineering. Given the sheer size of modern datasets, feature developers must (1) write code with few e ective clues about how their code will interact with the data and (2) repeatedly endure long system waits even though their code typically changes little from run to run. We propose brainwash, a vision for a feature engineer- ing data system that could dramatically ease the Explore- Extract-Evaluate interaction loop that characterizes many trained system projects.},

Until recently, this progress has been fueled mostly by advances in machine learning; however, more and more researchers are realizing the importance of studying users of these systems. In this article we promote this approach and demonstrate how it can result in better user experiences and more effective learning systems. We present a number of case studies that characterize the impact of interactivity, demonstrate ways in which some existing systems fail to account for the user, and explore new ways for learning systems to interact with their users. We argue that the design process for interactive machine learning systems should involve users at all stages: explorations that reveal human interaction patterns and inspire novel interaction methods, as well as refinement stages to tune details of the interface and choose among alternatives. After giving a glimpse of the progress that has been made so far, we discuss the challenges that we face in moving the field forward.},

Simple image- and text-recognition tasks have been successfully 'crowd-sourced' through games, but it is not clear if more complex scientific problems can be solved with human-directed computing. Protein structure prediction is one such problem: locating the biologically relevant native conformation of a protein is a formidable computational challenge given the very large size of the search space. Here we describe Foldit, a multiplayer online game that engages non-scientists in solving hard prediction problems. Foldit players interact with protein structures using direct manipulation tools and user-friendly versions of algorithms from the Rosetta structure prediction methodology, while they compete and collaborate to optimize the computed energy. We show that top-ranked Foldit players excel at solving challenging structure refinement problems in which substantial backbone rearrangements are necessary to achieve the burial of hydrophobic residues. Players working collaboratively develop a rich assortment of new strategies and algorithms; unlike computational approaches, they explore not only the conformational space but also the space of possible search strategies. The integration of human visual problem-solving and strategy development capabilities with traditional computational algorithms through interactive multiplayer games is a powerful new approach to solving computationally-limited scientific problems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comparative genomics, or the study of the relationships of genome structure and function across different species, offers a powerful tool for studying evolution, annotating genomes, and understanding the causes of various genetic disorders. However, aligning multiple sequences of DNA, an essential intermediate step for most types of analyses, is a difficult computational task. In parallel, citizen science, an approach that takes advantage of the fact that the human brain is exquisitely tuned to solving specific types of problems, is becoming increasingly popular. There, instances of hard computational problems are dispatched to a crowd of non-expert human game players and solutions are sent back to a central server.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We introduce Phylo, a human-based computing framework applying "crowd sourcing" techniques to solve the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) problem. The key idea of Phylo is to convert the MSA problem into a casual game that can be played by ordinary web users with a minimal prior knowledge of the biological context. We applied this strategy to improve the alignment of the promoters of disease-related genes from up to 44 vertebrate species. Since the launch in November 2010, we received more than 350,000 solutions submitted from more than 12,000 registered users. Our results show that solutions submitted contributed to improving the accuracy of up to 70{\%} of the alignment blocks considered.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that, combined with classical algorithms, crowd computing techniques can be successfully used to help improving the accuracy of MSA. More importantly, we show that an NP-hard computational problem can be embedded in casual game that can be easily played by people without significant scientific training. This suggests that citizen science approaches can be used to exploit the billions of "human-brain peta-flops" of computation that are spent every day playing games. Phylo is available at: http://phylo.cs.mcgill.ca.},

abstract = {As science becomes increasingly computational, the limits of what is computationally tractable become a barrier to scientific progress. Many scientific problems, however, are amenable to human problem solving skills that complement computational power. By leveraging these skills on a larger scale---beyond the relatively few individuals currently engaged in scientific inquiry---there is the potential for new scientific discoveries. This book presents a framework for mapping open scientific problems into video games. The game framework combines computational power with human problem solving and creativity to work toward solving scientific problems that neither computers nor humans could previously solve alone. To maximize the potential contributors to scientific discovery, the framework designs a game to be played by people with no formal scientific background and incentivizes long-term engagement with a myriad of collaborative or competitive reward structures. The framework allows for the continual coevolution of the players and the game to each other: as players gain expertise through gameplay, the game changes to become a better tool. The framework is validated by being applied to proteomics problems with the video game Foldit. Foldit players have contributed to novel discoveries in protein structure prediction, protein design, and protein structure refinement algorithms. The coevolution of human problem solving and computer tools in an incentivized game framework is an exciting new scientific pathway that can lead to discoveries currently unreachable by other methods.},

This paper discusses the design process used for Foldit, a multiplayer online biochemistry game that presents players with computationally difficult protein folding problems in the form of puzzles, allowing ordinary players to gain expertise and help solve these problems. The principle challenge of designing such scientific discovery games is harnessing the enormous collective problem-solving potential of the game playing population, who have not been previously introduced to the specific problem, or, often, the entire scientific discipline. To address this challenge, we took an iterative approach to designing the game, incorporating feedback from players and biochemical experts alike. Feedback was gathered both before and after releasing the game, to create the rules, interactions, and visualizations in Foldit that maximize contributions from game players. We present several examples of how this approach guided the game's design, and allowed us to improve both the quality of the gameplay and the application of player problem-solving.},

abstract = {Real-time captioning provides deaf and hard of hearing peo- ple immediate access to spoken language and enables partic- ipation in dialogue with others. Low latency is critical be- cause it allows speech to be paired with relevant visual cues. Currently, the only reliable source of real-time captions are expensive stenographers who must be recruited in advance and who are trained to use specialized keyboards. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is less expensive and available on- demand, but its low accuracy, high noise sensitivity, and need for training beforehand render it unusable in real-world situ- ations. In this paper, we introduce a new approach in which groups of non-expert captionists (people who can hear and type) collectively caption speech in real-time on-demand. We present LEGION:SCRIBE, an end-to-end system that allows deaf people to request captions at any time. We introduce an algorithm for merging partial captions into a single out- put stream in real-time, and a captioning interface designed to encourage coverage of the entire audio stream. Evaluation with 20 local participants and 18 crowd workers shows that non-experts can provide an effective solution for captioning, accurately covering an average of 93.2{\%} of an audio stream with only 10 workers and an average per-word latency of 2.9 seconds. More generally, our model in which multiple work- ers contribute partial inputs that are automatically merged in real-time may be extended to allow dynamic groups to sur- pass constituent individuals (even experts) on a variety of hu- man performance tasks.},

abstract = {Despite progress in perceptual tasks such as image classification, computers still perform poorly on cognitive tasks such as image description and question answering. Cognition is core to tasks that involve not just recognizing, but reasoning about our visual world. However, models used to tackle the rich content in images for cognitive tasks are still being trained using the same datasets designed for perceptual tasks. To achieve success at cognitive tasks, models need to understand the interactions and relationships between objects in an image. When asked "What vehicle is the person riding?", computers will need to identify the objects in an image as well as the relationships riding(man, carriage) and pulling(horse, carriage) in order to answer correctly that "the person is riding a horse-drawn carriage". In this paper, we present the Visual Genome dataset to enable the modeling of such relationships. We collect dense annotations of objects, attributes, and relationships within each image to learn these models. Specifically, our dataset contains over 100K images where each image has an average of 21 objects, 18 attributes, and 18 pairwise relationships between objects. We canonicalize the objects, attributes, relationships, and noun phrases in region descriptions and questions answer pairs to WordNet synsets. Together, these annotations represent the densest and largest dataset of image descriptions, objects, attributes, relationships, and question answers.},

abstract = {Web-based social data analysis tools that rely on public discussion to produce hypotheses or explanations of patterns and trends in data rarely yield high-quality results in practice. Crowdsourcing offers an alternative approach in which an analyst pays workers to generate such explanations. Yet, asking workers with varying skills, backgrounds and motivations to simply “Explain why a chart is interesting” can result in irrelevant, unclear or speculative explanations of variable quality. To address these problems, we contribute seven strategies for improving the quality and diversity of worker-generated explanations. Our experiments show that using (S1) feature-oriented prompts, providing (S2) good examples, and including (S3) reference gathering, (S4) chart reading, and (S5) annotation subtasks increases the quality of responses by 28{\%} for US workers and 196{\%} for non- US workers. Feature-oriented prompts improve explanation quality by 69{\%} to 236{\%} depending on the prompt. We also show that (S6) pre-annotating charts can focus workers' attention on relevant details, and demonstrate that (S7) generating explanations iteratively increases explanation diversity without increasing worker attrition. We used our techniques to generate 910 explanations for 16 datasets, and found that 63{\%} were of high quality. These results demonstrate that paid crowd workers can reliably generate diverse, high-quality explanations that support the analysis of specific datasets.},

Such techniques are valuable in discovering problematic cases that do not reveal themselves during the normal operation of the system, and may include cases that are rare but catastrophic. We describe the design of the system, including design iterations that did not quite work. In particular, the system incentivizes humans to provide examples that are difficult for the model to handle, by providing a reward proportional to the magnitude of the predictive model's error. The humans are asked to "Beat the Machine" and find cases where the automatic model ("the Machine") is wrong. Experiments show that the humans using Beat the Machine identify more errors than traditional techniques for discovering errors in from predictive models, and indeed, they identify many more errors where the machine is confident it is correct. Further, the cases the humans identify seem to be not simply outliers, but coherent areas missed completely by the model. Beat the machine identifies the "unknown unknowns."

abstract = {Crowdsourcing and human computation enable organizations to accomplish tasks that are currently not possible for fully automated techniques to com- plete, or require more flexibility and scalability than traditional employment relationships can facilitate. In the area of data processing, companies have benefited from crowd workers on platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk or Upwork to complete tasks as varied as content moderation, web con- tent extraction, entity resolution, and video/audio/image processing. Several academic researchers from diverse areas ranging from the social sciences to computer science have embraced crowdsourcing as a research area, result- ing in algorithms and systems that improve crowd work quality, latency, or cost. Given the relative nascence of the field, the academic and the practi- tioner communities have largely operated independently of each other for the past decade, rarely exchanging techniques and experiences. In this book, we aim to narrow the gap between academics and practitioners. On the academic side, we summarize the state of the art in crowd-powered algorithms and system design tailored to large-scale data processing. On the industry side, we survey 13 industry users (e.g., Google, Facebook, Microsoft) and 4 mar- ketplace providers of crowd work (e.g., CrowdFlower, Upwork) to identify how hundreds of engineers and tens of million dollars are invested in various crowdsourcing solutions. Through the book, we hope to simultaneously intro- duce academics to real problems that practitioners encounter every day, and provide a survey of the state of the art for practitioners to incorporate into their designs. Through our surveys, we also highlight the fact that crowd- powered data processing is a large and growing field. Over the next decade, we believe that most technical organizations will in some way benefit from crowd work, and hope that this book can help guide the effective adoption of crowdsourcing across these organizations.},

In this paper, we seek to understand YA's knowledge sharing and activity. We analyze the forum categories and cluster them according to content characteristics and patterns of interaction among the users. While interactions in some categories resemble expertise sharing forums, others incorporate discussion, everyday advice, and support. With such a diversity of categories in which one can participate, we find that some users focus narrowly on specific topics, while others participate across categories. This not only allows us to map related categories, but to characterize the entropy of the users' interests. We find that lower entropy correlates with receiving higher answer ratings, but only for categories where factual expertise is primarily sought after. We combine both user attributes and answer characteristics to predict, within a given category, whether a particular answer will be chosen as the best answer by the asker.},

This book was the brainchild of Yuri Rubinski, co-founder of SoftQuad, who in addition to organizing Doug's 1995 SoftQuad Web Award at the conference, wished to create a special tribute for attendees that outlined Doug's vision for the future. So in collaboration with Doug's business partner and daughter Christina Engelbart (working under an oath of secrecy), Yuri produced this timeless keepsake to be distributed in a surprise unveiling to Doug at the award presentation. This new release has been published by MRW Connected for the Doug Engelbart Institute to mark the 40th anniversary of Doug's 1968 Demo. Our intent was to make this important work more widely available, while still honoring the original 2000 copies as limited edition keepsakes. This new edition is a near exact replica of the original softcover edition, in its artful style and craftsmanship, with the exception of the new cover design and title page.},

This is often a very attractive alternative to manually constructing them, and in the last decade the use of machine learning has spread rapidly throughout computer science and beyond. Machine learning is used in Web search, spam filters, recommender systems, ad placement, credit scoring, fraud detection, stock trading, drug design, and many other applications. A recent report from the McKinsey Global Institute asserts that machine learning (a.k.a. data mining or predictive analytics) will be the driver of the next big wave of innovation. Several fine textbooks are available to interested practitioners and researchers (for example, Mitchell and Witten et al.). However, much of the “folk knowledge” that is needed to successfully develop machine learning applications is not readily available in them. As a result, many machine learning projects take much longer than necessary or wind up producing less-than-ideal results. Yet much of this folk knowledge is fairly easy to communicate. This is the purpose of this article.},

The triples are chosen adaptively based on the labels of the previously discovered features on the data set. In two natural models of features, hierarchical and independent, we show that a simple adaptive algorithm, using "two-out-of-three" similarity queries, recovers all features with less labor than any nonadaptive algorithm.

Such systems raise many implementation questions. Perhaps the most fundamental question is that the closed world assumption underlying relational query semantics does not hold in such systems. As a consequence the meaning of even simple queries can be called into question. Furthermore, query progress monitoring becomes difficult due to non-uniformities in the arrival of crowdsourced data and peculiarities of how people work in crowdsourcing systems. To address these issues, we develop statistical tools that enable users and systems developers to reason about query completeness. These tools can also help drive query execution and crowdsourcing strategies. We evaluate our techniques using experiments on a popular crowdsourcing platform.},

However, creating organizational hierarchies is difficult because the process requires a global understanding of the objects to be categorized. Usually one is created by an individual or a small group of people working together for hours or even days. Unfortunately, this centralized approach does not work well for the large, quickly changing datasets found on the web. Cascade is an automated workflow that allows crowd workers to spend as little at 20 seconds each while collectively making a taxonomy. We evaluate Cascade and show that on three datasets its quality is 80-90{\%} of that of experts. Cascade has a competitive cost to expert information architects, despite taking six times more human labor. Fortunately, this labor can be parallelized such that Cascade will run in as fast as four minutes instead of hours or days.},

These mechanisms of classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms, and in many cases on machine learning algorithms to do this work. In this article, I draw a distinction between three forms of opacity: (1) opacity as intentional corporate or state secrecy, (2) opacity as technical illiteracy, and (3) an opacity that arises from the characteristics of machine learning algorithms and the scale required to apply them usefully. The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves. I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight code audit. I argue that recognizing the distinct forms of opacity that may be coming into play in a given application is a key to determining which of a variety of technical and non-technical solutions could help to prevent harm.},

This paper explores immersion further by investigating whether immersion can be defined quantitatively, describing three experiments in total. The first experiment investigated participants' abilities to switch from an immersive to a non-immersive task. The second experiment investigated whether there were changes in participants' eye movements during an immersive task. The third experiment investigated the effect of an externally imposed pace of interaction on immersion and affective measures (state anxiety, positive affect, negative affect). Overall the findings suggest that immersion can be measured subjectively (through questionnaires) as well as objectively (task completion time, eye movements). Furthermore, immersion is not only viewed as a positive experience: negative emotions and uneasiness (i.e. anxiety) also run high. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Opportunities for participation by members of the public are expanding the information arena of disaster. Social media supports " backchannel " communications, allowing for wide-scale interaction that can be collectively resourceful, self-policing, and generative of information that is otherwise hard to obtain. Results from our study of information practices by members of the public during the October 2007 Southern California Wildfires suggest that community information resources and other backchannel communications activity enabled by social media are gaining prominence in the disaster arena, despite concern by officials about the legitimacy of information shared through such means. We argue that these emergent uses of social media are pre-cursors of broader future changes to the institutional and organizational arrangements of disaster response.},

abstract = {The work aims to improve the assessment of creative problem-solving in science education by employing language technologies and computational-statistical machine learning methods to grade students' natural language responses automatically. To evaluate constructs like creative problem-solving with validity, open-ended questions that elicit students' constructed responses are beneficial. But the high cost required in manually grading constructed responses could become an obstacle in applying open-ended questions. In this study, automated grading schemes have been developed and evaluated in the context of secondary Earth science education. Empirical evaluations revealed that the automated grading schemes may reliably identify domain concepts embedded in students' natural language responses with satisfactory inter-coder agreement against human coding in two sub-tasks of the test (Cohen's Kappa = .65-.72). And when a single holistic score was computed for each student, machine-generated scores achieved high inter-rater reliability against human grading (Pearson's r = .92). The reliable performance in automatic concept identification and numeric grading demonstrates the potential of using automated grading to support the use of open-ended questions in science assessments and enable new technologies for science learning. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Engagement is a key reason for introducing gamification to learning and thus serves as an important measurement of its effectiveness. Based on a literature review and meta-synthesis, this paper proposes a comprehensive framework of engage- ment in gamification for learning. The framework sketches out the connections among gamification strategies, dimensions of engagement, and the ultimate learning outcome. It also elic- its other task - and user - related factors that may potentially impact the effect of gamification on learner engagement. To verify and further strengthen the framework, we conducted a user study to demonstrate that: 1) different gamification strategies can trigger different facets of engagement; 2) the three dimensions of engagement have varying effects on skill acquisition and transfer; and 3) task nature and learner charac- teristics that were overlooked in previous studies can influence the engagement process. Our framework provides an in-depth understanding of the mechanism of gamification for learning, and can serve as a theoretical foundation for future research and design. Author},

abstract = {Learning about a new area of knowledge is challenging for novices partly because they are not yet aware of which topics are most important. The Internet contains a wealth of information for learning the underlying structure of a domain, but relevant sources often have diverse structures and emphases, making it hard to discern what is widely considered essential knowledge vs. what is idiosyncratic. Crowdsourcing offers a potential solution because humans are skilled at evaluating high-level structure, but most crowd micro-tasks provide limited context and time. To address these challenges, we present Crowdlines, a system that uses crowdsourcing to help people synthesize diverse online information. Crowdworkers make connections across sources to produce a rich outline that surfaces diverse perspectives within important topics. We evaluate Crowdlines with two experiments. The first experiment shows that a high context, low structure interface helps crowdworkers perform faster, higher quality synthesis, while the second experiment shows that a tournament-style (parallelized) crowd workflow produces faster, higher quality, more diverse outlines than a linear (serial/iterative) workflow.},

In Crowdclass, we design questions to serve as both a learning experience and a scientific classification. This is different from conventional citizen science platforms which decompose high-level questions into a series of simple microtasks that require no scientific background knowledge to complete. We facili-tate learning within the microtask by providing content that is appropriate for the participant's level of knowledge through scaffolding learning. We conduct a between-group study of 93 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk comparing Crowd-class to the popular citizen science project Galaxy Zoo. We find that the scaffolding presentation of content enables learn-ing of more challenging concepts. By understanding the rela-tionship between user motivation, learning, and performance, we draw general design principles for learning-as-an-incentive interventions applicable to other crowdsourcing applications.},

Crowdsourcing could help this process through on-demand harnessing of flexible and powerful human cognition, but incurs other challenges including limited attention and expertise. Further, text data can be complex, high-dimensional, and ill-structured. We address two major challenges unsolved in prior crowd clustering work: scaffolding expertise for novice crowd workers, and creating consistent and accurate categories when each worker only sees a small portion of the data. To address these challenges we present an empirical study of a two-stage approach to enable crowds to create an accurate and useful overview of a dataset: A) we draw on cognitive theory to assess how re-representing data can shorten and focus the data on salient dimensions; and B) introduce an iterative clustering approach that provides workers a global overview of data. We demonstrate a classification-plus-context approach elicits the most accurate categories at the most useful level of abstraction.},

abstract = {The participation of non-professionally trained people in so-called citizen science (CS) projects is a much discussed topic at the moment. Frequently, however, the contribution of citizens is limited to only a few narrow tasks. Focusing on an initiative dedicated to the study of the human microbiome, this paper describes such a case where citizen participation is limited to the provision of funding, samples, and personal data. Researchers opted for a crowdsourced approaches because other forms of funding and recruitment did not seem feasible. We argue that despite the narrow understanding of participation in the context of some CS projects, they can address some of the democratic concerns related to scientific knowledge creation. For example, CS and crowdsourcing can help to foster dialogue between researchers and publics, and increase the influence of citizens on research agenda setting.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTCitizen science broadly describes citizen involvement in science. Citizen science has gained significant momentum in recent years, brought about by widespread availability of smartphones and other Internet and communications technologies (ICT) used for collecting and sharing data. Not only are more projects being launched and more members of the public participating, but more human–computer interaction (HCI) researchers are focusing on the design, development, and use of these tools. Together, citizen science and HCI researchers can leverage each other's skills to speed up science, accelerate learning, and amplify society's well-being globally as well as locally. The focus of this article is on HCI and biodiversity citizen science as seen primarily through the lens of research in the author's laboratory. The article is framed around five topics: community, data, technology, design, and a call to save all species, including ourselves. The article ends with a research agenda that focuses on these ar...},

abstract = {In most online citizen science projects, a large proportion of participants contribute in small quantities. To investigate how low contributors differ from committed volunteers, we distributed a survey to members of the Old Weather project, followed by interviews with respondents selected according to a range of contribution levels. The studies reveal a complex relationship between motivations and contribution. Whilst high contributors were deeply engaged by social or competitive features, low contributors described a solitary experience of 'dabbling' in projects for short periods. Since the majority of participants exhibit this small-scale contribution pattern, there is great potential value in designing interfaces to tempt lone workers to complete 'just another page', or to lure early drop-outs back into participation. This includes breaking the work into components which can be tackled without a major commitment of time and effort, and providing feedback on the quality and value of these contributions.},

How to motivate workers to stay longer and/or perform better in crowdsourcing systems is a critical question for designers. Previous work have explored different motivational frameworks, both extrinsic and intrinsic. In this work, we examine the potential for curiosity as a new type of intrinsic motivational driver to incentivize crowd workers. We design crowdsourcing task interfaces that explicitly incorporate mechanisms to induce curiosity and conduct a set of experiments on Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Our experiment results show that curiosity interventions improve worker retention without degrading performance, and the magnitude of the effects are influenced by both the personal characteristics of the worker and the nature of the task.},

However, creating organizational hierarchies is difficult because the process requires a global understanding of the objects to be categorized. Usually one is created by an individual or a small group of people working together for hours or even days. Unfortunately, this centralized approach does not work well for the large, quickly changing datasets found on the web. Cascade is an automated workflow that allows crowd workers to spend as little at 20 seconds each while collectively making a taxonomy. We evaluate Cascade and show that on three datasets its quality is 80-90{\%} of that of experts. Cascade has a competitive cost to expert information architects, despite taking six times more human labor. Fortunately, this labor can be parallelized such that Cascade will run in as fast as four minutes instead of hours or days.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

As the sustainability of online citizen science projects depends on volunteers who contribute their skills, time, and energy, the objective of this study is to investigate effects of motivational factors on the quantity and quality of citizen scientists' contribution. Building on the social movement participation model, findings from a longitudinal empirical study in three different citizen science projects reveal that quantity of contribution is determined by collective motives, norm-oriented motives, reputation, and intrinsic motives. Contribution quality, on the other hand, is positively affected only by collective motives and reputation. We discuss implications for research on the motivation for participation in technology-mediated social participation and for the practice of citizen science.},

We present findings from a study of the motivational factors affecting participation in ecological citizen science projects. We show that volunteers are motivated by a complex framework of factors that dynamically change throughout their cycle of work on scientific projects; this motivational framework is strongly affected by personal interests as well as external factors such as attribution and acknowledgment. Identifying the pivotal points of motivational shift and addressing them in the design of citizen-science systems will facilitate improved collaboration between scientists and volunteers.},

abstract = {Gamification is growing increasingly prevalent as a means to incentivize user engagement of social media sites that rely on user contributions. Badges, or equivalent rewards such as top-contributor lists that are used to recognize a user's contributions on a site, clearly appear to be valued by users who actively pursue and compete for them. However, different sites use different badge designs, varying how, and for what, badges are awarded— some sites such as StackOverflow award badges for meeting fixed levels of contribution, while others like Amazon and Y! Answers reward users for being amongst some top set of contributors on the site, corresponding to a competitive standard of performance. Given that users value badges, and that contributing to a site requires effort, how badges are designed will affect the incentives— and therefore the participation and effort— elicited from strategic users on a site. We take a game-theoretic approach to badge design, analyzing the incentives created by widely-used badge designs in a model where winning a badge is valued and effort is costly, and potential contributors to the site endogenously decide whether or not to participate, and how much total effort to put into their contributions to the site. We analyze equilibrium existence, and equilibrium participation and effort in an absolute standards mechanismM$\alpha$ where badges are awarded for meeting some absolute level of (observed) effort, and a relative standards mechanismM$\rho$ corresponding to competitive standards as in a top-$\rho$ contributor badge.We find that equilibria always exist in both mechanisms, even when the value from winning a badge depends endogenously on the number of other winners. However,M$\alpha$ has zero-participation equilibria for standards that are too high, whereas all equilibria inM$\rho$ elicit non-zero participation for all possible $\rho$, provided $\rho$ is specified as a fixed number rather than as a fraction of actual contributors (note that the two are not equivalent in a setting with endogenous participation). Finally, we ask whether or not a site should explicitly announce the number of users winning a badge; the answer to this question is determined by the curvature of the value of winning the badge as a function of the number of other winners. 1.},

Existing projects have demonstrated the value of using volunteers to collect data, but few projects have reached the full collaborative potential of scientists and volunteers. Understanding the shared and unique motivations of these two groups can help designers establish the technical and social infrastructures needed to promote effective partnerships. We present findings from a study of the motivational factors affecting participation in ecological citizen science projects. We show that volunteers are motivated by a complex framework of factors that dynamically change throughout their cycle of work on scientific projects; this motivational framework is strongly affected by personal interests as well as external factors such as attribution and acknowledgment. Identifying the pivotal points of motivational shift and addressing them in the design of citizen-science systems will facilitate improved collaboration between scientists and volunteers.},

This paper seeks to gain a more systematic understanding of crowd science and to provide scholars with a conceptual framework and an agenda for future research. First, we briefly present three case examples that span different fields of science and illustrate the heterogeneity concerning what crowd science projects do and how they are organized. Second, we identify two fundamental elements that characterize crowd science projects - open participation and open sharing of intermediate inputs - and distinguish crowd science from other knowledge production regimes such as innovation contests or traditional "Mertonian" science. Third, we explore potential knowledge-related and motivational benefits that crowd science offers over alternative organizational modes, and potential challenges it is likely to face. Drawing on prior research on the organization of problem solving, we also consider for what kinds of tasks particular benefits or challenges are likely to be most pronounced. We conclude by outlining an agenda for future research and by discussing implications for funding agencies and policy makers. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Citizen science is a research practice that relies on public contributions of data. The strong recognition of its educational value combined with the need for novel methods to handle subsequent large and complex data sets raises the question: Is citizen science effective at science? A quantitative assessment of the contributions of citizen science for its core purpose - scientific research - is lacking. We examined the contribution of citizen science to a review paper by ornithologists in which they formulated ten central claims about the impact of climate change on avian migration. Citizen science was never explicitly mentioned in the review article. For each of the claims, these ornithologists scored their opinions about the amount of research effort invested in each claim and how strongly the claim was supported by evidence. This allowed us to also determine whether their trust in claims was, unwittingly or not, related to the degree to which the claims relied primarily on data generated by citizen scientists. We found that papers based on citizen science constituted between 24 and 77{\%} of the references backing each claim, with no evidence of a mistrust of claims that relied heavily on citizen-science data. We reveal that many of these papers may not easily be recognized as drawing upon volunteer contributions, as the search terms "citizen science" and "volunteer" would have overlooked the majority of the studies that back the ten claims about birds and climate change. Our results suggest that the significance of citizen science to global research, an endeavor that is reliant on long-term information at large spatial scales, might be far greater than is readily perceived. To better understand and track the contributions of citizen science in the future, we urge researchers to use the keyword "citizen science" in papers that draw on efforts of non-professionals.},

abstract = {Millions of learners today use how-to videos to master new skills in a variety of domains. But browsing such videos is often tedious and inefficient because video player interfaces are not optimized for the unique step-by-step structure of such videos. This research aims to improve the learning experience of existing how-to videos with step-by-step annotations. We first performed a formative study to verify that annotations are actually useful to learners. We created ToolScape, an interactive video player that displays step descriptions and intermediate result thumbnails in the video timeline. Learners in our study performed better and gained more self-efficacy using ToolScape versus a traditional video player. To add the needed step annotations to existing how-to videos at scale, we introduce a novel crowdsourcing workflow. It extracts step-by-step structure from an existing video, including step times, descriptions, and before and after images. We introduce the Find-Verify-Expand design pattern for temporal and visual annotation, which applies clustering, text processing, and visual analysis algorithms to merge crowd output. The workflow does not rely on domain-specific customization, works on top of existing videos, and recruits untrained crowd workers. We evaluated the workflow with Mechanical Turk, using 75 cooking, makeup, and Photoshop videos on YouTube. Results show that our workflow can extract steps with a quality comparable to that of trained annotators across all three domains with 77{\%} precision and 81{\%} recall.},

But there is as yet little empirical support for their effectiveness. This paper presents a qualitative study of two types of community code engagements: Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and hackathons. We investigated the range of outcomes these engagements produce and the underlying practices that lead to these outcomes. In GSoC, the vision and experience of core members of the community influence project selection, and the intensive mentoring process facilitates creation of strong ties. Most GSoC projects result in stable features. The agenda setting phase of hackathons reveals high priority issues perceived by the community. Social events among the relatively large numbers of participants over brief engagements tend to create weak ties. Most hackathons result in prototypes rather than finished tools. We discuss themes and tradeoffs that suggest directions for future empirical work around designing community code engagements.},

abstract = {Scientific research performed with the involvement of the broader public (the crowd) attracts increasing attention from scientists and policy makers. A key premise is that project organizers may be able to draw on underused human resources to advance research at relatively low cost. Despite a growing number of examples, systematic research on the effort contributions volunteers are willing to make to crowd science projects is lacking. Analyzing data on seven different projects, we quantify the financial value volunteers can bring by comparing their unpaid contributions with counterfactual costs in traditional or online labor markets. The volume of total contributions is substantial, although some projects are much more successful in attracting effort than others. Moreover, contributions received by projects are very uneven across time—a tendency toward declining activity is interrupted by spikes typically resulting from outreach efforts or media attention. Analyzing user-level data, we find that most contributors participate only once and with little effort, leaving a relatively small share of users who return responsible for most of the work. Although top contributor status is earned primarily through higher levels of effort, top contributors also tend to work faster. This speed advantage develops over multiple sessions, suggesting that it reflects learning rather than inherent differences in skills. Our findings inform recent discussions about potential benefits from crowd science, suggest that involving the crowd may be more effective for some kinds of projects than others, provide guidance for project managers, and raise important questions for future research.},

We review and integrate recent work in these and other fields, which has converged such that we propose the term public participation in scientific research (PPSR) to discuss initiatives from diverse fields and traditions. We describe three predominant models of PPSR and call upon case studies suggesting that—regardless of the research context—project outcomes are influenced by (1) the degree of public participation in the research process and (2) the quality of public participation as negotiated during project design. To illustrate relationships between the quality of participation and outcomes, we offer a framework that considers how scientific and public interests are negotiated for project design toward multiple, integrated goals. We suggest that this framework and models, used in tandem, can support deliberate design of PPSR efforts that will enhance their outcomes for scientific research, individual},

Tasks like genome annotation, image analysis, knowledge-base population and protein structure determination all benefit from human input. In some cases, people are needed in vast quantities, whereas in others, we need just a few with rare abilities. Crowdsourcing encompasses an emerging collection of approaches for harnessing such distributed human intelligence. Recently, the bioinformatics community has begun to apply crowdsourcing in a variety of contexts, yet few resources are available that describe how these human-powered systems work and how to use them effectively in scientific domains. RESULTS: Here, we provide a framework for understanding and applying several different types of crowdsourcing. The framework considers two broad classes: systems for solving large-volume 'microtasks' and systems for solving high-difficulty 'megatasks'. Within these classes, we discuss system types, including volunteer labor, games with a purpose, microtask markets and open innovation contests. We illustrate each system type with successful examples in bioinformatics and conclude with a guide for matching problems to crowdsourcing solutions that highlights the positives and negatives of different approaches.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The concept of citizen science (CS) is currently referred to by many actors inside and outside science and research. Several descriptions of this purportedly new approach of science are often heard in connection with large datasets and the possibilities of mobilizing crowds outside science to assists with observations and classifications. However, other accounts refer to CS as a way of democratizing science, aiding concerned communities in creating data to influence policy and as a way of promoting political decision processes involving environment and health.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: In this study we analyse two datasets (N = 1935, N = 633) retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) with the aim of giving a scientometric description of what the concept of CS entails. We account for its development over time, and what strands of research that has adopted CS and give an assessment of what scientific output has been achieved in CS-related projects. To attain this, scientometric methods have been combined with qualitative approaches to render more precise search terms.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Results indicate that there are three main focal points of CS. The largest is composed of research on biology, conservation and ecology, and utilizes CS mainly as a methodology of collecting and classifying data. A second strand of research has emerged through geographic information research, where citizens participate in the collection of geographic data. Thirdly, there is a line of research relating to the social sciences and epidemiology, which studies and facilitates public participation in relation to environmental issues and health. In terms of scientific output, the largest body of articles are to be found in biology and conservation research. In absolute numbers, the amount of publications generated by CS is low (N = 1935), but over the past decade a new and very productive line of CS based on digital platforms has emerged for the collection and classification of data.},

abstract = {Through a study of field biology practices, we observed that biology fieldwork generates a wealth of qualitative and quantitative information requiring substantial labor to coor- dinate and distill. Biologists rely on their notebooks as the primary record of observations, plans, measurements, and results. These observations motivated ButterflyNet, a sys- tem that integrates paper notes with information explicitly captured and ambiently available in field sites: digital pho- tographs, sensor network data, and GPS. Through Butter- flyNet, the activity of leafing through a notebook expands to browsing all synchronously created media. Butter- flyNet's integrated interactions facilitate the transfer of notebook content to spreadsheets and maintain data lineage. It also enables biologists to share their work with other members of their lab. A first-use study with 14 biologists found this system to offer richer capture with minimal overhead, in a manner felicitous with current practice.},

It can facilitate the connectivity and collaboration of people, organizations, and societies. We believe that Information Systems scholars are in a unique position to make significant contributions to this emerging research area and consider it as a new research frontier. However, so far, few studies have elaborated what have been achieved and what should be done. This paper seeks to present a critical examination of the substrate of crowdsourcing research by surveying the landscape of existing studies, including theoretical foundations, research methods, and research foci, and identifies several important research directions for IS scholars from three perspectives—the participant, organization, and system—and which warrant further study. This research contributes to the IS literature and provides insights for researchers, designers, policy-makers, and managers to better understand various issues in crowdsourcing systems and projects.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen an increase in the number of citizen science initiatives, which harness the contribution from large numbers of volunteers to support a scientific project, much like other internet-based crowdsourcing applications. In some cases, citizen science projects are based on volunteer computing, where people contribute their computer resources to the project (rather than contributing their manual effort). The most notable example of these projects is SETI@home, where contributors allocate their personal computing resources to be used for detecting intelligent life outside Earth. Other citizen science initiatives, on the other hand, rely on the manual effort of contributors, for example Galaxy Zoo, a web-based distributed analysis project where contributors classify images of galaxies, or the Citizen Weather Observer Program (CWOP) where volunteers monitor the environment and contribute weather data. Common to all these initiatives is the use of the internet as the primary platform for enabling distributed, volunteered, citizen science contribution. These initiatives represent a paradigm shift in scientific research, reducing substantially operating costs and increasing the involvement of the general public. We term this new breed of internet-based citizen science ‘Science Sourcing', or simply ‘SciSourcing'. In this workshop position paper we briefly review the field, identify gaps in the current literature, introduce our own research program in this area, and describe preliminary results from two recent empirical studies.},

In a first experiment, we perform a comparison of five differ-ent training strategies. For complex web search challenges, we show that providing expert examples is an effective form of training, surpassing other forms of training in nearly all measures of interest. However, such training relies on ac-cess to domain expertise, which may be expensive or lacking. Therefore, in a second experiment we study the feasibility of training workers in the absence of domain expertise. We show that having workers validate the work of their peer workers can be even more effective than having them review expert examples if we only present solutions filtered by a thresh-old length. The results suggest that crowdsourced solutions of peer workers may be harnessed in an automated training pipeline.},

abstract = {Teachers are well aware that their primary challenge is motivating students. Through teacher research, the authors have found that reframing curricular topics as inquiry promotes engagement, literacy, and deep learning for all students, especially reluctant ones, and invites them into the classroom project as full and necessary participants. Inquiry is a particularly democratic form of teaching and learning that privileges preexisting interests, unique perspectives, and the various strengths of students who typically may be marginalized in school. Inquiry meets the needs of all students, particularly those who are reluctant, because it makes the purpose of learning explicit, provides opportunities to make and do things with what is learned, helps students stake their identities as learners and allows students to achieve visible signs of competence, deep understanding, and actual accomplishment. This article explores the different inquiry approaches as the authors look at the three major steps in reframing curriculum into inquiry: using essential questions, identifying culminating projects, and sequencing instructional activity to develop real and demonstrable expertise over time.

We present three steps in the development of these ideas. First, as a note on research methodology, we outline a series of exploratory studies that were conducted. Secondly, we describe a prototype system called "Bricks" and a sample application, GraspDraw, which was developed to investigate the Graspable UI concepts and to design new one- and two- handed interaction techniques. The physical artifacts, or bricks, operate on top of a large horizontal display surface known as the ActiveDesk. Finally, we conclude by presenting a design space for Bricks which lay the foundation for further exploring and developing graspable user interfaces.},

abstract = {New technologies are rapidly changing the way we collect, archive, analyze, and share scientific data. For example, over the next several years it is estimated that more than one billion autonomous sensors will be deployed over large spatial and temporal scales, and will gather vast quantities of data. Networks of human observers play a major role in gathering scientific data, and whether in astronomy, meteorology, or observations of nature, they continue to contribute significantly. In this paper we present an innovative use of the Internet and information technologies that better enhances the opportunity for citizens to contribute their observations to science and the conservation of bird populations. eBird is building a web-enabled community of bird watchers who collect, manage, and store their observations in a globally accessible unified database. Through its development as a tool that addresses the needs of the birding community, eBird sustains and grows participation. Birders, scientists, and conservationists are using eBird data worldwide to better understand avian biological patterns and the environmental and anthropogenic factors that influence them. Developing and shaping this network over time, eBird has created a near real-time avian data resource producing millions of observations per year. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In modern crowdsourcing markets, requesters face the challenge of training and managing large transient workforces. Requesters can hire peer workers to review others' work, but the value may be marginal, especially if the reviewers lack requisite knowledge. Our research explores if and how workers learn and improve their performance in a task domain by serving as peer reviewers. Further, we investigate whether peer reviewing may be more effective in teams where the reviewers can reach consensus through discussion. An online between-subjects experiment compares the tradeoffs of reviewing versus producing work using three different organization strategies: working individually, working as an interactive team, and aggregating individuals into nominal groups. The results show that workers who review others' work perform better on subsequent tasks than workers who just produce. We also find that interactive reviewer teams outperform individual reviewers on all quality measures. However, aggregating individual reviewers into nominal groups produces better quality assessments than interactive teams, except in task domains where discussion helps overcome individual misconceptions.

In Experiment 1, we manipulated assessment expectations in group and individual brainstorming. Although productivity was higher when subjects worked under personal rather than collective assessment instructions, type of session still had a major impact on brainstorming productivity under conditions that eliminated the temptation to free ride. Experiment 2 demonstrated that inducing evaluation apprehension reduced productivity in individual brainstorming. However, the failure to find an interaction between evaluation apprehension and type of session in Experiment 3 raises doubts about evaluation apprehension as a major explanation of the productivity loss in brainstorming groups. Finally, by manipulating blocking directly, we determined in Experiment 4 that production blocking accounted for most of the productivity loss of real brainstorming groups. The processes underlying production blocking are discussed, and a motivational interpretation of blocking is offered.},

abstract = {We conduct the first natural field experiment to explore the relationship between the "meaningfulness" of a task and worker effort. We employed about 2500 workers from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), an online labor market, to label medical images. Although given an identical task, we experimentally manipulated how the task was framed. Subjects in the meaningful treatment were told that they were labeling tumor cells in order to assist medical researchers, subjects in the zero-context condition (the control group) were not told the purpose of the task, and, in stark contrast, subjects in the shredded treatment were not given context and were additionally told that their work would be discarded. We found that when a task was framed more meaningfully, workers were more likely to participate. We also found that the meaningful treatment increased the quantity of output (with an insignificant change in quality) while the shredded treatment decreased the quality of output (with no change in quantity). We believe these results will generalize to other short-term labor markets. Our study also discusses MTurk as an exciting platform for running natural field experiments in economics. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Each student uses his or her own tablet to share text ideas in a synchronized, visual environment. The system is designed to promote diverse participation and increase en- gagement. Our findings are based on observations of twelve class sessions and interviews with participating students. In- stead of simply introducing an additional text-based com- munication channel into the classroom, we find that the sys- tem creates a new “stage” (in the Goffman sense) on which students could perform in ways that the main spoken stage could not support. This stage coexists with spoken commu- nication, and augments how students attend to the material and each other. We conclude that spoken participation alone poses barriers for some participants and the addition of a non-oral, text-based stage can help establish equitable and engaging discussions in the class.},

We present an interaction framework in which groups of learners are formed on demand and then proceed through a sequence of activities that include synchronous group discussion about learnergenerated responses. Via controlled experiments with crowdworkers, we show that discussing challenging problems leads to better outcomes than working individually, and incentivizing people to help one another yields still better results. We then show that providing a mini-lesson in which workers consider the principles underlying the tested concept and justify their answers leads to further improvements. Combining the mini-lesson with the discussion of the multiple-choice question leads to significant improvements on that question. We also find positive subjective responses to the peer interactions, suggesting that discussions can improve morale in remote work or learning settings.},

abstract = {A growing number of large online collaborative idea generation platforms promise that by ideating together, people can create better ideas than any would have alone. But how might these platforms best leverage the number and diversity of contributors to help each contributor generate even better ideas? Prior research suggests that seeing examples of ideas generated by others can improve one's own ideation outcomes, but the benefit may depend on how creative and how diverse (i.e., different from each other) these examples are. There already exist scalable crowd-powered mechanisms to evaluate creativity of individual ideas, but few options exist for assessing the diversity of ideas. We contribute a new scalable crowd-powered method for evaluating the diversity of sets of ideas. The method relies on simple comparisons of similarity (is idea A more similar to B or C?) generated by a large number of non-expert contributors. We build on prior work on multidimensional scaling and active similarity learning techniques to create an abstract spatial idea map. Our validation study reveals that human raters agree with the estimates of dissimilarity derived from our idea map as much or more than they agree with each other. The results of our main experiment demonstrate that diverse sets of examples generated automatically using our idea map improve the diversity of ideas generated by participants compared to seeing randomly selected examples. Our results also corroborate findings from prior research showing that people presented with creative examples generated more creative ideas than those who saw a set of random examples. We see this work as a step toward building more effective online systems for supporting large scale collective ideation.},

Up to the first month of our deployment, 59 users have held conversations with Chorus during 320 conversational sessions.

The anecdotal re telling of this narrative to one's associates constitutes the mechanism for incorporating the diagnostic experience into the community expertise. These anecdotes are remembered and used or referred to during the diagnosis of other difficult problems or when seeking help. Individual expertise is in part the ability to interpret the anecdotes, to abstract the information about the machine from the context of the story. The participation of the community in remembering and using these anecdotes gives the community the flexibility to adapt to the unforeseen problems which are necessarily part of the service function.},

The quantity of messages in the computer conference was smaller but more task related than in the face-to-face conversations because participants reflected more on ideas and perspectives in reaching their decisions. A cluster analysis of communication patterns showed that computer-mediated group decisions more closely resembled the general problem-solving process of problem definition, orientation, and solution development as group interaction progressed, while the face-to-face group interactions tended to follow a linear sequence of interactions. Participants who solved problems through computer conferencing were more satisfied with the process and believed that there was a greater quality in the problem-solving process.},

abstract = {We present the Meeting Mediator (MM), a real-time portable system that detects social interactions and provides persua- sive feedback to enhance group collaboration. Social inter- actions is captured using Sociometric badges [17] and are visualized on mobile phones to promote behavioral change. Particularly in distributed collaborations, MM attempts to bridge the gap among the distributed groups by detecting and communicating social signals. In a study on brainstorming and problem solving meetings, MM had a significant effect on overlapping speaking time and interactivity level with- out distracting the subjects. The Sociometric badges were also able to detect dominant players in the group and mea- sure their influence on other participants. Most interestingly, in groups with one or more dominant people, MM effec- tively reduced the dynamical difference between co-located and distributed collaboration as well as the behavioral differ- ence between dominant and non-dominant people. Our sys- tem encourages change in group dynamics that may lead to higher performance and satisfaction. We envision that MM will be deployed in real-world organizations to improve in- teractions across various group collaboration contexts.},

abstract = {Flexibility is a key aspiration of contemporary government guidance on school design. Used liberally, the term provides a convenient site for the meeting of educational approach (think flexible, personalised learning, timetabling, groupings) and spatial design (non-bounded, open space, moveable elements, independent structure and services). However, this meeting seems to pose a challenge. As Building Bulletin 95 puts it: '{\ldots}the most flexibly designed spaces can only work if building users have a flexible attitude.' Framing flexibility in the discourse of autonomy, this paper contends that it can be understood as a 'tool' to enable children to experience authorship of their own learning. The paper draws on participatory action research with primary and secondary schools in England in which the built environment and placemaking were explored as a means to support learning. Through examples, it is argued that once children are enabled to experience their learning environment as 'flexible', by changing it themselves, they are better able to self-direct their learning. Findings show that flexible learning space is encouraged when children and teachers experience together how their environment can support their learning needs. Once established, it is an environment that is constantly changing according to the needs of individuals and groups. The paper concludes that flexibility, at the congruence of spatial design and learning, can only be attained once children feel trusted to shape their environment within an enabling school culture.

abstract = {Presents an "Opener Scale" that measures the tendency to elicit intimate disclosure from others. Data from 740 undergraduates provided evidence for the scale's validity and reliability. In a face-to-face dyadic interaction between strangers in a laboratory study, 55 undergraduate women who scored either high or low on the Opener Scale were paired with other women who scored either high or low on a self-disclosure index. Low disclosers revealed more to high openers than to low openers. However, high disclosers were equally intimate with both types of partner. In a field study with 54 sorority women, acquaintances and friends were more willing to disclose to high openers than to low openers. High openers were more liked than low openers in the latter study only. It is suggested that high openers were able to elicit more disclosure because of their greater receptiveness and attentiveness and use of more follow-up questions.

abstract = {The printing press long ago and the computer today have made widespread access to information possible. Learning theorists have suggested, however, that mere information is a poor way to learn. Instead, more effective learning comes through doing. While the most popularized element of today's MOOCs are the video lectures, many MOOCs also include interactive activities that can afford learning by doing. This paper explores the learning benefits of the use of informational assets (e.g., videos and text) in MOOCs, versus the learning by doing opportunities that interactive activities provide. We find that students doing more activities learn more than students watching more videos or reading more pages. We estimate the learning benefit from extra doing (1 SD increase) to be more than six times that of extra watching or reading. Our data, from a psychology MOOC, is correlational in character, however we employ causal inference mechanisms to lend support for the claim that the associations we find are causal.},

And, existing ARbased learning content has just focused on interactions among users and on three-dimensional imaging techniques while the collaborative element has not been taken into account fully. Against the backdrop, a rule-based interactive storytelling element has been introduced to the system that offers a variety of contents at a user's choice so as to draw attention and interests. To verify the effectiveness of such learning system, an experiment was conducted with primary school students who went through a performance assessment of ‘Growing Peach Tree'. The experiment proved the learning system effective with a high score of 80.4, which is equivalent to that of debate-based learning.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of Web. 2.0 technologies on the ways learning can be conceived of as a narrative process within contemporary contexts, using blogs as an illustrative example. It is premised on the concept of narrative as a way in which individuals represent and organize experience in order to learn from it and make it shareable with others within social contexts. The first part of the paper offers a theoretical analysis of the role of narrative in the social construction of knowledge by the ways it enables users of Web 2.0 technologies to participate meaningfully in the exchange of experiences and ideas. The second part of the paper offers a ‘situated' analysis of the narrative practices engaged with by users of blogs. A ‘narrative trail' is used to provide a contextualized instance of the narrative practices which are involved. The paper concludes by examining the research issues which are raised and suggests a research agenda which is needed to explore Web 2.0 technologies as social utilities affecting knowledge production, in which the adaptation of narrative theory is a central feature.

I will cover five interrelated areas: journaling, observing, listening, writing and rigour. The term 'research product' refers to the outcome of the research process. By that I mean the dissertation, the research report or the published article. The notion of legitimacy is informed by Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics which does not show us what to do, but asks us to question what is 'going on' while researching. In this paper I ask you to consider the entire research process as a reflexive exercise which provides answers to the question: 'What is going on in methods?'. I claim that if the research product is well sign-posted, the readers will be able to travel easily through the worlds of the participants and makers of the story and decide for themselves whether the story is a legitimate research endeavour.},

abstract = {This paper elaborates some aspects of narrative learning-defined here as learning to tell stories and learning from, about and through narratives-in the context of primary-age pupils who use English as an Additional Language (EAL). The paper introduces some principles to support their language development in classroom interaction. We argue that linguistically orientated research on metacognitive strategy development is not necessarily readily applied to EAL learners. After presenting a background on narrative, narrative development and social aspects of telling stories, we introduce an approach to narrative development which encourages a cycle telling and retelling of stories which provides EAL learners with layered opportunities for developing the metacognitive features of planning, remembering, understanding and reflecting on storytelling. This is enabled through the use of written "keywords", which are used in conjunction with "story maps" (which outline the narrative structure and content) together with classroom photos. While the focus of the paper is on EAL learners, the visual approach described here can be used with narrative (or factual information) for many other young children and has been used by speech and language therapists to develop specific aspects of language for speech and language impaired children.

For relatively short-lived assignments, like those of online crowdsourcing, personality matching could provide a simple, scalable strategy for effective team formation. However, it is not clear how (or if) personality differences affect teamwork in this novel context where the workforce is more transient and diverse. This study examines how personality compatibility in crowd teams affects performance and individual perceptions. Using the DISC personality test, we composed 14 five-person teams (N=70) with either a harmonious coverage of personalities (balanced) or a surplus of leader-type personalities (imbalanced). Results show that balancing for personality leads to significantly better performance on a collaborative task. Balanced teams exhibited less conflict and their members reported higher levels of satisfaction and acceptance. This work demonstrates a simple personality matching strategy for forming more effective teams in crowdsourcing contexts.},

Through observation and interviews, we identify several distinct roles played by physical artifacts in the classrooms, such as providing a reference to necessary foreign-language material and serving as props in creative role-play. The range of roles taken on by artifacts and the attitudes students have toward them provide a basis for our discussion about how technology might be more effectively introduced into the socially negotiated environment of the introductory foreign-language classroom. We identify the need to balance between collaborative and personal technology in a stressful, but social, context. Our findings inform a range of roles that technology can undertake in replacing or augmenting existing classroom artifacts.},

Data analyses revealed that three factors were significantly related to student perceptions—clarity and consistency in course design, contact with and feedback from course instructors, and active and valued discussion. An explanation for these findings may center on the importance of creating opportunities for interaction in online learning environments. In this vein, preliminary findings from research on the development of community in online course discussions is presented. Drawn from co...},

Despite being an excellent learning tool with global reach, MOOC has its own set of limitations which results in incredibly low rate of course completion. Conservative techniques of content presentation (fixed video, audio, scripts) lack personalization and interaction. There is a need for MOOC to embrace advanced learning techniques to provide more engaging experience to its learners. This paper delves into three such techniques namely, Augmented Reality, Adaptive Learning and Gamification. It illustrates the positive impact of these techniques in present learning scenario and studies how these techniques are being adopted by MOOC to generate interactive and more engaging content.},

abstract = {From paper to computers, the way that we have been writing down thoughts and performing symbolic computations has been constantly evolving. Teaching methods closely follow this trend, leveraging existing technology to make teaching more e ective and preparing students for their later careers with the available technology. Right now, in 2012, we are in the middle of another technology shift: instead of using PCs and laptops, mobile devices are becoming more prevalent for most everyday computing tasks. In fact, never before in human history were incredibly powerful and versatile com- puting devices such as smartphones available and adopted so broadly. We propose that computer programming, and thus the teaching of programming, can and should be done directly on the mobile devices themselves, without the need for a separate PC or laptop to write code. Programming on smartphones that we carry around with us at all times means instant grati cation for students, as they can show their games and applications to their friends, and it means that students can do their homework or additional practic- ing at all times. We describe TouchDevelop, a novel mobile programming environment, and call out challenges that need to be overcome and opportunities that it creates.},

abstract = {Designing interactive learning environments (ILEs; e.g., in- telligent tutoring systems, educational games, etc.) is a chal- lenging interdisciplinary process that needs to satisfy multi- ple stakeholders. ILEs need to function in real educational settings (e.g., schools) in which a number of goals interact. Several instructional design methodologies exist to help de- velopers address these goals. However, they often lead to conflicting recommendations. Due to the lack of an estab- lished methodology to resolve such conflicts, developers of ILEs have to rely on ad-hoc solutions. We present a princi- pled methodology to resolve such conflicts. We build on a well-established design process for creating Cognitive Tu- tors, a highly effective type of ILE. We extend this process by integrating methods from multiple disciplines to resolve design conflicts. We illustrate our methodology's effective- ness by describing the iterative development of the Fractions Tutor, which has proven to be effective in classroom studies with 3,000 4th-6th graders.},

abstract = {Many Internet services depend on the integrity of their users, even when$\backslash$nthese users have strong incentives to behave dishonestly. Drawing on$\backslash$nexperiments in two different online contexts, this study measures the$\backslash$nprevalence of cheating and evaluates two different methods for deterring$\backslash$nit. Our first experiment investigates cheating behavior in a pair of$\backslash$nonline exams spanning 632 students in India. Our second experiment$\backslash$nexamines dishonest behavior on Mechanical Turk through an online task$\backslash$nwith 2,378 total participants. Using direct measurements that are not$\backslash$ndependent on self-reports, we detect significant rates of cheating in$\backslash$nboth environments. We confirm that honor codes despite frequent use in$\backslash$nmassive open online courses (MOOCs) lead to only a small and$\backslash$ninsignificant reduction in online cheating behaviors. To overcome these$\backslash$nchallenges, we propose a new intervention: a stern warning that spells$\backslash$nout the potential consequences of cheating. We show that the warning$\backslash$nleads to a significant (about twofold) reduction in cheating, consistent$\backslash$nacross experiments. We also characterize the demographic correlates of$\backslash$ncheating on Mechanical Turk. Our findings advance the understanding of$\backslash$ncheating in online environments, and suggest that replacing traditional$\backslash$nhonor codes with warnings could be a simple and effective way to deter$\backslash$ncheating in online courses and online labor marketplaces.},

abstract = {The main goal of this paper is to show that crowdworkers collaborate to fulfill technical and social needs left by the platform they work on. That is, crowdworkers are not the independent, autonomous workers they are often assumed to be, but instead work within a social network of other crowdworkers. Crowdworkers collaborate with members of their networks to 1) manage the administrative overhead associated with crowdwork, 2) find lucrative tasks and reputable employers and 3) recreate the social connections and support often associated with brick and mortar-work environments. Our evidence combines ethnography, interviews, survey data and larger scale data analysis from four crowdsourcing platforms, emphasizing the qualitative data from the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform and Microsoft's proprietary crowdsourcing platform, the Universal Human Relevance System (UHRS). This paper draws from an ongoing, longitudinal study of crowdwork that uses a mixed methods approach to understand the cultural meaning, political implications, and ethical demands of crowdsourcing.},

The strategy, Copying Answers using Multiple Existences Online (CAMEO), involves a user who gathers solutions to assessment questions using a "harvester" account and then submits correct answers using a separate "master" account. We use a small-scale experiment to verify CAMEO and estimate a "lower bound" for its prevalence among 1.9 million course participants in 115 MOOCs from two universities. Using conservative thresholds, we estimate CAMEO prevalence at 1237 certificates, accounting for 1.3{\%} of the certificates in the 69 MOOCs with CAMEO users. Among earners of 20 or more certificates, 25{\%} have used the CAMEO strategy. CAMEO users are more likely to be young, male, and international than other MOOC certificate earners. We identify preventive strategies that can decrease CAMEO rates and show evidence of their effectiveness in science courses.},

One method that has not yet seen widespread use is the educational campaign: large-scale, short-term events focused on a specific educational topic, such as the Hour of Code campaign. These are designed to generate media coverage and lend themselves nicely to collaborative or competitive goals, thus potentially leveraging social effects and community excitement to increase engagement and reach students who otherwise would not participate. In this article, we present a case study of three such campaigns that we ran to encourage students to play an algebra game—DragonBox Adaptive: the Washington, Norway, and Minnesota Algebra Challenges. We provide several design recommendations for future campaigns based on our experience, including the effects of different incentive schemes, the insertion of “tests” to fast-forward students to levels of appropriate difficulty, and the strengths and weaknesses of campaigns as a method of collecting experimental data.},

In mobile computing location is usually used to approximate context and to implement context-aware applications. We propose that ultra-mobile computing, characterized by devices that are operational and operated while on the move (e.g. PDAs, mobile phones, wearable computers), can significantly benefit from a wider notion of context. To structure the field we introduce a working model for context, discuss mechanisms to acquire context beyond location, and application of context-awareness in ultra-mobile computing. We investigate the utility of sensors for context-awareness and present two prototypical implementations - a light-sensitive display and an orientation-aware PDA interface. The concept is then extended to a model for sensor fusion to enable more sophisticated context recognition. Based on an implementation of the model an experiment is described and the feasibility of the approach is demonstrated. Further, we explore fusion of sensors for acquisition of information on more sophisticated contexts.},

Following an explanation of big data and how it is different from previously available learner data, we describe three notable features that characterize assessment with big data and provide three case studies that exemplify the potential of these features. The three case studies are set in different kinds of online learning environments: an online environment with interactive exercises and intelligent tutoring, an online programming practice environment, and a massive open online course (MOOC). Every interaction in online environments can be recorded and, thereby, offer an unprecedented amount of data about the processes of learning. We argue that big data enriches the assessment process by enabling the continuous diagnosis of learners' knowledge and related states, and by promoting learning through targeted feedback},

We interviewed 21 experienced usability professionals, including in-house experts, external consultants, and managers working in a variety of complex domains, and uncovered the challenges commonly posed by domain complexity and how practitioners work around them. We found that despite the best efforts by usability professionals to get familiar with complex domains on their own, the lack of formal domain expertise can be a significant hurdle for carrying out effective usability evaluations. Partnerships with domain experts lead to effective results as long as domain experts are willing to be an integral part of the usability team. These findings suggest that for achieving usability in complex domains, some fundamental educational changes may be needed in the training of usability professionals.},

abstract = {Increasingly, designers seek feedback on their designs from crowd platforms such as social networks, Web forums, and paid task markets which demand different amounts of social capital, financial resources, and time. Yet it is unknown how the choice of crowd platform affects feedback generation. We conducted an online study where designers created initial designs and revised the designs based on crowd feedback. We measured the quantity, quality, and content of the feedback received at two iterations and from crowds driven by social status, enjoyment, and financial gain. Our results show, for example, that task markets yield more suggestions, online forums provide more process feedback, and social networks give the most suggestions without payment. We contribute an emergent framework for crowd feedback selection, opportunities for enhancing feedback services, and an experimental platform that researchers can adapt to reduce the burden of conducting online studies of design feedback.},

abstract = {2002 IEEE-USAB Award for Distinguished Literary Contributions Furthering Engineering ProfessionalismOver the past thirty years, many people have proclaimed the imminent arrival of the paperless office. Yet even the World Wide Web, which allows almost any computer to read and display another computers documents, has increased the amount of printing done. The use of e-mail in an organization causes an average 40 percent increase in paper consumption. In The Myth of the Paperless Office, Abigail Sellen and Richard Harper use the study of paper as a way to understand the work that people do and the reasons they do it the way they do. Using the tools of ethnography and cognitive psychology, they look at paper use from the level of the individual up to that of organizational culture.Central to Sellen and Harpers investigation is the concept of "affordances"the activities that an object allows, or affords. The physical properties of paper (its being thin, light, porous, opaque, and flexible) afford the human actions of grasping, carrying, folding, writing, and so on. The concept of affordance allows them to compare the affordances of paper with those of existing digital devices. They can then ask what kinds of devices or systems would make new kinds of activities possible or better support current activities. The authors argue that paper will continue to play an important role in office life. Rather than pursue the ideal of the paperless office, we should work toward a future in which paper and electronic document tools work in concert and organizational processes make optimal use of both.},

abstract = {We provide the first treatment of typo-tolerant password authentication for arbitrary user-selected passwords. Such a system, rather than simply rejecting a login attempt with an incorrect password, tries to correct common typographical errors on behalf of the user. Limited forms of typo-tolerance have been used in some industry settings, but to date there has been no analysis of the utility and security of such schemes. We quantify the kinds and rates of typos made by users via studies conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk and via instru- mentation of the production login infrastructure at Dropbox. The instrumentation at Dropbox did not record user passwords or otherwise change authentication policy, but recorded only the frequency of observed typos. Our experiments reveal that almost 10{\%} of login attempts fail due to a handful of simple, easily correctable typos, such as capitalization errors. We show that correcting just a few of these typos would reduce login delays for a significant fraction of users as well as enable an additional 3{\%} of users to achieve successful login. We introduce a framework for reasoning about typo-tolerance, and investigate the seemingly inherent tension here between security and usability of passwords. We use our framework to show that there exist typo-tolerant authentication schemes that can get corrections for “free”: we prove they are as secure as schemes that always reject mistyped passwords. Building off this theory, we detail a variety of practical strategies for securely implementing typo-tolerance. I.},

abstract = {Large cloud service providers have invested in increasingly larger datacenters to house the computing infrastructure re- quired to support their services. Accordingly, researchers and industry practitioners alike have focused a great deal of effort designing network fabrics to efficiently interconnect and manage the traffic within these datacenters in perfor- mant yet efficient fashions. Unfortunately, datacenter oper- ators are generally reticent to share the actual requirements of their applications, making it challenging to evaluate the practicality of any particular design. Moreover, the limited large-scale workload information available in the literature has, for better or worse, heretofore largely been provided by a single datacenter operator whose use cases may not be widespread. In this work, we report upon the network traffic observed in some of Facebook's dat- acenters. While Facebook operates a number of traditional datacenter services like Hadoop, its core Web service and supporting cache infrastructure exhibit a number of behav- iors that contrast with those reported in the literature. We report on the contrasting locality, stability, and predictability of network traffic in Facebook's datacenters, and comment on their implications for network architecture, traffic engi- neering, and switch design.},

abstract = {The economic urgency around higher education is undeniable: the price of tuition has soared; student loan debt now exceeds {\$}1 trillion and is greater than credit card debt; the dollars available from government sources for colleges are expected to shrink in the years to come; and the costs for traditional institutions to stay competitive continue to rise. At the same time, more education does not necessarily lead to better outcomes.1 Employers are demanding more academic credentials for every kind of job yet are at the same time increasingly vocal about their dissatisfaction with the variance in quality of degree holders.2 The signaling effect of a college degree appears to be an imprecise encapsulation of one's skills for the knowledge economy of the times. McKinsey analysts estimate that the number of skillsets needed in the workforce has increased rapidly from 178 in September 2009 to 924 in June 2012.3 Students themselves are demanding more direct connections with employers: 87.9 percent of college freshmen cited getting a better job as a vital reason for pursuing a college degree in the 2012 University of California Los Angeles' Higher Education Research Institute's “American Freshman Survey”—approximately 17 percentage points higher than in the same survey question in 2006;4 a survey of the U.S. public by Gallup and the Lumina Foundation confirmed similarly high numbers.5 “Learning and work are becoming inseparable,” argued the authors of a report from the Institute for Public Policy Research, “indeed one could argue that this is precisely what it means to have a knowledge economy or a learning society. It follows that if work is becoming learning, then learning needs to become work—and universities need to become alive to the possibilities.”},

abstract = {AN NYRB Classics OriginalIn 1869, at the age of twenty-four, the precociously brilliant Friedrich Nietzsche was appointed to a professorship of classical philology at the University of Basel. He seemed marked for a successful and conventional academic career. Then the philosophy of Schopenhauer and the music of Wagner transformed his ambitions. The genius of such thinkers and makers—the kind of genius that had emerged in ancient Greece—this alone was the touchstone for true understanding. But how was education to serve genius, especially in a modern society marked more and more by an unholy alliance between academic specialization, mass-market journalism, and the militarized state? Something more than sturdy scholarship was called for. A new way of teaching and questioning, a new philosophy . . . What that new way might be was the question Nietzsche broached in five vivid, popular public lectures in Basel in 1872. Anti-Education presents a provocative and timely reckoning with what remains one of the central challenges of the modern world.},

abstract = {While there has been an explosion of impressive, data-driven AI applications in recent years, machines still largely lack a deeper understanding of the world to answer questions that go beyond information explicitly stated in text, and to explain and discuss those answers. To reach this next generation of AI applications, it is imperative to make faster progress in areas of knowledge, modeling, reasoning, and language. Standardized tests have often been proposed as a driver for such progress, with good reason: Many of the questions require sophisticated understanding of both language and the world, pushing the boundaries of AI, while other questions are easier, supporting incremental progress. In Project Aristo at the Allen Institute for AI, we are working on a specific version of this challenge, namely having the computer pass Elementary School Science and Math exams. Even at this level there is a rich variety of problems and question types, the most difficult requiring significant progress in AI. Here we propose this task as a challenge problem for the community, and are providing supporting datasets. Solutions to many of these problems would have a major impact on the field so we encourage you: Take the Aristo Challenge!},

The second is a reference section, which includes a catalog of the 75 most important algorithmic problems. By browsing this catalog, readers can quickly identify what the problem they have encountered is called, what is known about it, and how they should proceed if they need to solve it. This book is ideal for the working professional who uses algorithms on a daily basis and has need for a handy reference. This work can also readily be used in an upper-division course or as a student reference guide.THE ALGORITHM DESIGN MANUAL comes with a CD-ROM that contains: a complete hypertext version of the full printed book. the source code and URLs for all cited implementations. over 30 hours of audio lectures on the design and analysis of algorithms are provided, all keyed to on-line lecture notes.},

abstract = {There is a vast supply of prior art that study models for mental processes. Some studies in psychology and philosophy approach it from an inner perspective in terms of experiences and percepts. Others such as neurobiology or connectionist-machines approach it externally by viewing the mind as complex circuit of neurons where each neuron is a primitive binary circuit. In this paper, we also model the mind as a place where a circuit grows, starting as a collection of primitive components at birth and then builds up incrementally in a bottom up fashion. A new node is formed by a simple composition of prior nodes when we undergo a repeated experience that can be described by that composition. Unlike neural networks, however, these circuits take "concepts" or "percepts" as inputs and outputs. Thus the growing circuits can be likened to a growing collection of lambda expressions that are built on top of one another in an attempt to compress the sensory input as a heuristic to bound its Kolmogorov Complexity.},

The thermodynamic theory of such structures is outlined. A microscopic definition of irreversible processes is given, and a transformation theory is developed that allows one to introduce nonunitary equations of motion that explicitly display irreversibility and approach to thermodynamic equilibrium. The work of the group at the University of Brussels in these fields is briefly reviewed.

The evolution of the quantum state is governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that interpolates between an initial Hamiltonian, whose ground state is easy to construct, and a final Hamiltonian, whose ground state encodes the satisfying assignment. To ensure that the system evolves to the desired final ground state, the evolution time must be big enough. The time required depends on the minimum energy difference between the two lowest states of the interpolating Hamiltonian. We are unable to estimate this gap in general. We give some special symmetric cases of the satisfiability problem where the symmetry allows us to estimate the gap and we show that, in these cases, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.},

@article{Goel2010,
abstract = {The success of "infinite-inventory" retailers such as Amazon.com and Netflix has been ascribed to a "long tail" phenomenon. To wit, while the majority of their inventory is not in high demand, in aggregate these "worst sellers," unavailable at limited-inventory competitors, generate a significant fraction of total revenue. The long tail phenomenon, however, is in principle consistent with two fundamentally different theories. The first, and more popular hypothesis, is that a majority of consumers consistently follow the crowds and only a minority have any interest in niche content; the second hypothesis is that everyone is a bit eccentric, consuming both popular and specialty products. Based on examining extensive data on user preferences for movies, music, Web search, and Web browsing, we find overwhelming support for the latter theory. However, the observed eccentricity is much less than what is predicted by a fully random model whereby every consumer makes his product choices independently and proportional to product popularity; so consumers do indeed exhibit at least some a priori propensity toward either the popular or the exotic. Our findings thus suggest an additional factor in the success of infinite-inventory retailers, namely, that tail availability may boost head sales by offering consumers the convenience of "one-stop shopping" for both their mainstream and niche interests. This hypothesis is further supported by our theoretical analysis that presents a simple model in which shared inventory stores, such as Amazon Marketplace, gain a clear advantage by satisfying tail demand, helping to explain the emergence and increasing popularity of such retail arrangements. Hence, we believe that the return-on-investment (ROI) of niche products goes beyond direct revenue, extending to second-order gains associated with increased consumer satisfaction and repeat patronage. More generally, our findings call into question the conventional wisdom that specialty products only appeal to a minority of consumers.},

abstract = {Recent developments in information technology have brought about important changes in distributed computing. New environments such as massively large-scale, wide-area computer networks and mobile ad hoc networks have emerged. Common characteristics of these environments include extreme dynamicity, unreliability, and large scale. Traditional approaches to designing distributed applications in these environments based on central control, small scale, or strong reliability assumptions are not suitable for exploiting their enormous potential. Based on the observation that living organisms can effectively organize large numbers of unreliable and dynamically-changing components (cells, molecules, individuals, etc.) into robust and adaptive structures, it has long been a research challenge to characterize the key ideas and mechanisms that make biological systems work and to apply them to distributed systems engineering. In this article we propose a conceptual framework that captures several basic biological processes in the form of a family of design patterns. Examples include plain diffusion, replication, chemotaxis, and stigmergy. We show through examples how to implement important functions for distributed computing based on these patterns. Using a common evaluation methodology, we show that our bio-inspired solutions have performance comparable to traditional, state-of-the-art solutions while they inherit desirable properties of biological systems including adaptivity and robustness.},

abstract = {For over 40 years the notion of the file, as devised by pioneers in the field of computing, has been the subject of much contention. Some have wanted to abandon the term altogether on the grounds that metaphors about files can confuse users and designers alike. More recently, the emergence of the ‘cloud' has led some to suggest that the term is simply obsolescent. In this paper we want to suggest that, despite all these conceptual debates and changes in technology, the term file still remains central to systems architectures and to the concerns of users. Notwithstanding pro-found changes in what users do and technologies afford, we suggest that files continue to act as a cohering concept, something like a ‘boundary object' between computer engineers and users. However, the effectiveness of this boundary object is now waning. There are increasing signs of slip-page and muddle. Instead of throwing away the notion altogether, we propose that the definition of and use of files as a boundary object be reconstituted. New abstractions are needed, ones which reflect what users seek to do with their digital data, and which allow engineers to solve the net-working, storage and data management problems that ensue when files move from the PC on to the networked world of today.},

We present results from an interview study involving 22 older adults (age 71-92) to understand communication preferences and values related to social media. Seniors articulate many concerns with online social media, including the time required for legitimate participation, the loss of deeper communication, content irrelevance, and privacy. Additionally, older adults engage in social practices that could be supported by online social technologies, but they rarely use such tools. The theme of material social communications emerges from our data, and we examine this in context of online social media. We conclude with design considerations for the development of social media for older adults, and as part of this we describe the notion of bridging technologies as a framework for intergenerational communication design.},

abstract = {We present an interactive, hybrid human-computer method for object classification. The method applies to classes of objects that are recognizable by people with appropriate expertise (e.g.,animal species or airplane model), but not (in general) by people without such expertise. It can be seen as a visual version of the 20 questions game,where questions based on simple visual attributes are posed interactively. The goal is to identify the true class while minimizing the number of questions asked, using the visual content of the image. We introduce a general framework for incorporating almost any off-the-shelf multi-class object recognition algorithm into the visual 20 questions game, and provide methodologies to account for imperfect user responses and unreliable computer vision algorithms. We evaluate our methods on Birds-200, a difficult dataset of 200 tightly-related bird species, and on the Animals With Attributes dataset. Our results demonstrate that incorporating user input drives up recognition accuracy to levels that are good enough for practical appli- cations, while at the same time, computer vision reduces the amount of human interaction required.},

Much research in mobile and wireless networking over the past decade has examined ways of reducing energy usage, including specific techniques such as energy-aware protocols for routing and communication. However, to our knowledge, no systematic way has been developed for reasoning generally about the energy consumption of algorithms. A method for analyzing energy complexity at an abstract algorithmic level would be invaluable. However, it is not clear if we can develop a uniform abstract model of energy complexity that has both theoretical and practical value. This paper surveys techniques for modeling and minimizing energy consumption at various system levels, so as to place algorithmic energy complexity in perspective. We then discuss the attributes an energy complexity model should have, and describe our initial approach towards developing such a model. We end by discussing future technical directions.},

We outline the basic set of functionality required for the implementation of our vision for peer assessment in an online environment and present the results of a preliminary study we conducted in a flipped classroom. We found that the quality of the summative assessment produced by the peers matched that of experts, and we encountered strong evidence that our peer assessment implementation had positive effects on achievement.

Unfortunately, in parallel, authoritarian regimes and other entities (such as ISPs) for their vested interests have curtailed this flow by partially or fully censoring the web. The policy, mechanism, and extent of this censorship varies from country to country. We present the first study of the cause, effect, and mechanism of web censorship in Pakistan. Specifically, we use a publicly available list of blocked websites and check their accessibility from multiple networks within the country. Our results indicate that the censorship mechanism varies across websites: some are blocked at the DNS level while others at the HTTP level. Interestingly, the government shifted to a centralized, Internet exchange level censorship system during the course of our study, enabling our findings to compare two generations of blocking systems. Furthermore, we report the outcome of a controlled survey to ascertain the mechanisms that are being actively employed by people to circumvent censorship. Finally, we discuss some simple but surprisingly unexplored methods of bypassing restrictions.},

abstract = {Themain objectives of massive open online courses (MOOC) are to foster knowledge through free high quality learning materials procurement; to create new knowledge through di- verse users' interactions with the providing platform; and to empower research on learning. However, MOOC providers are also businesses (either profit or not-for-profit). They are still in the early stages of their development, but sooner or later, in order to secure their existence and assure their longterm growth, they will have to adapt a business model and monetize the services they provide. Nevertheless, de- spite their popularity MOOCs are characterized by a very high drop-out rate (about 90{\%} [33, 22, 26]), which may turn out to be a problem regardless of the adapted busi- ness model. Hence, MOOC providers can either assume the scale benefits to be sufficiently high to ignore the problem of low MOOC completion rate or tackle this problem. In this paper we explore the problem of the high drop- out rate in massive open online courses. First, we identify its main cause by conducting an online survey, namely bad time organization. Secondly, we provide suggestions to re- duce the rate. Specifically, we argue that MOOC platforms should not only provide their users with high quality educa- tional materials and interaction facilities. But they should also support and assist the users in their quest for knowl- edge. Thus, MOOC platforms should provide tools helping them optimize their time usage and subsequently develop metacognitive skills indispensable in proper time manage- ment of learning processes.

We show how the event-based approach common to GUIs can apply to augmented paper, and describe additions to address paper's distinguishing characteristics. To understand the developer experience of this architecture, we deployed the toolkit to 17 student teams for six weeks. Analysis of the developers' code provided insight into the appropriateness of events for paper UIs. The usage patterns we distilled informed a second iteration of the toolkit, which introduces techniques for integrating interactive and batched input handling, coordinating interactions across devices, and debugging paper applications. The study also revealed that programmers created gesture handlers by composing simple ink measurements. This desire for informal interactions inspired us to include abstractions for recognition. This work has implications beyond paper - designers of graphical tools can examine API usage to inform iterative toolkit development.},

Several smartwatches are using small graphical displays and as such are adopting similar forms. However, there are indications that other designs could be feasible. We discuss how smartwatches might use non-graphical displays and still offer "smart" capabilities. To demonstrate feasibility, we present two smartwatch prototypes and show how LED arrays can be used to dynamically support several functions needed by smartwatch applications. Finally, we discuss some tradeoffs associated with this approach and point to additional opportunities for investigating smartwatch designs.},

In this paper, we document underlying forces that constitute a third wave in HCI and suggest sys- temic consequences for the CHI community. We provi- sionally name this the ‘phenomenological matrix'. In the course of creating technologies such as ubiquitous computing, visualization, affective and educational technology, a variety of approaches are addressing is- sues that are bad fits to prior paradigms, ranging from embodiment to situated meaning to values and social issues. We demonstrate the underlying unity of these approaches, and document how they suggest the cen- trality of currently marginal criteria for design, evalua- tion, appreciation, and developmental methodology in CHI work.

The new evidence reviewed here points to some genetic component in Black-White differences in mean IQ. The implication for public policy is that the discrimination model (i.e., Black-White differences in socially valued outcomes will be equal barring discrimination) must be tempered by a distributional model (i.e., Black-White outcomes reflect underlying group characteristics).},

abstract = {We present a science-centric evaluation of a 19-day sensor network deployment at Reventador, an active volcano in Ecuador. Each of the 16 sensors continuously sampled seismic and acoustic data at 100 Hz. Nodes used an event-detection algorithm to trigger on interesting volcanic activity and initiate reliable data transfer to the base station. During the deployment, the network recorded 229 earthquakes, eruptions, and other seismoacoustic events. The science requirements of reliable data collection, accurate event detection, and high timing precision drive sensor networks in new directions for geophysical monitoring. The main contribution of this paper is an evaluation of the sensor network as a scientific instrument, holding it to the standards of existing instrumentation in terms of data fidelity (the quality and accuracy of the recorded signals) and yield (the quantity of the captured data). We describe an approach to time rectification of the acquired signals that can recover accurate timing despite failures of the underlying time synchronization protocol. In addition, we perform a detailed study of the sensor network's data using a direct comparison to a standalone data logger, as well as an investigation of seismic and acoustic wave arrival times across the network.},

abstract = {Current practice in Human Computer Interaction as encouraged by educational institutes, academic review processes, and institutions with usability groups advocate usability evaluation as a critical part of every design process. This is for good reason: usability evaluation has a significant role to play when conditions warrant it. Yet evaluation can be ineffective and even harmful if naively done 'by rule' rather than 'by thought'. If done during early stage design, it can mute creative ideas that do not conform to current interface norms. If done to test radical innovations, the many interface issues that would likely arise from an immature technology can quash what could have been an inspired vision. If done to validate an academic prototype, it may incorrectly suggest a design's scientific worthiness rather than offer a meaningful critique of how it would be adopted and used in everyday practice. If done without regard to how cultures adopt technology over time, then today's reluctant reactions by users will forestall tomorrow's eager acceptance. The choice of evaluation methodology - if any - must arise from and be appropriate for the actual problem or research question under consideration.},

abstract = {Previous studies have invested much effort in understanding how participation in asynchronous online discussion affects student learning, and what factors influence student participation behavior. Results of these studies have been inconclusive and these investigations are often conducted from isolated perspectives. Relying on social cognitive theory, this study proposes two dynamic student participation models in online dialogue and particularly highlights understudied factors - collective efficacy, social ability, reading behavior, the time dimension of participation - to examine the mediation and causal relationship among those factors and their influence on learning. The models are tested utilizing data collected from a large US university. Specifically, while the predictive constructs are operationalized through the survey instruments, the outcome measures are modeled using electronic trace data and actual evaluation information. Data is analyzed using the Partial Least Squares modeling method. Results demonstrate the intertwined relationship among constructs and a different influencing mechanism for each construct on participation behavior and learning. By comparing these two built models, the time dimension of participation is shown to be more influential in predicting student learning than posting and reading actions. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of this study.},

Instead of teaching some currently fashionable programming language, it employed Scheme and functional programming to teach important ideas. Introductory courses based on the book showed up around the world and made Scheme and functional programming popular. Unfortunately, these courses quickly disappeared again due to shortcomings of the book and the whimsies of Scheme. Worse, the experiment left people with a bad impression of Scheme and functional programming in general. In this pearl, we propose an alternative role for functional programming in the first-year curriculum. Specifically, we present a framework for discussing the first-year curriculum and, based on it, the design rationale for our book and course, dubbed How to Design Programs. The approach emphasizes the systematic design of programs. Experience shows that it works extremely well as a preparation for a course on object-oriented},

abstract = {Learning objects (LOs) are important online resources for both learners and instructors and usage for LOs is growing. Automatic LO tracking collects large amounts of metadata about individual students as well as data aggregated across courses, learning objects, and other demographic characteristics (e.g. gender). The challenge becomes identifying which of the many variables derived from tracked data are useful for predicting student learning. This challenge has prompted considerable research in the field of educational data mining and learning analytics. This work advances such research in four ways. First, we bring together two approaches for finding salient variables from separate research areas: hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) from education and Lasso feature selection from computer science. Second, we show that these two approaches have complimentary and synergistic results with some variables considers salient by both and others salient by only one. Third, and most importantly, we demonstrate the benefits of a combined approach that considers a variable salient when either HLM or Lasso consider that variable salient. This combined approach both improves model predictive accuracy and finds additional variables considered salient in previous datasets on student learning. Lastly, we use the results to provide insights into the salient variables to the learning outcome in undergraduate CS education. Overall, this work suggests a combined approach that improves the identification of salient variables in big data and also improves the design of LO tracking systems for learning management systems.},

abstract = {We report findings from interviews with new undergraduate students, in which they identified particular items as supporting a sense of connectedness with home. We characterize ways in which artifacts underpinned a sense of connection, including by conveying the character of the parental home, supporting a sense of continuity with it, and enabling a physical presence to be maintained there. We then consider how simple affordances offered by these artifacts, such as being able to move, position and sort them, enabled participants to reinforce the meanings that were associated with them. Such actions are normally taken for granted, but we describe how they are compromised for social media especially, due to functional limitations and questions of ownership. We highlight design opportunities for making the transition from home more gradual, and supporting the archiving and display of social media.},

abstract = {Student ratings of teaching have been used, studied, and debated for almost a century. This article examines student ratings of teaching from a statistical perspective. The common practice of relying on averages of student teaching evaluation scores as the primary measure of teaching effectiveness for promotion and tenure decisions should be abandoned for substantive and statistical reasons: There is strong evidence that student responses to questions of “effectiveness” do not measure teaching effectiveness. Response rates and response variability matter. And comparing averages of categorical responses, even if the categories are represented by numbers, makes little sense. Student ratings of teaching are valuable when they ask the right questions, report response rates and score distributions, and are balanced by a variety of other sources and methods to evaluate teaching.},

abstract = {Throughout their education, engineering design students not only learn the design process, but also form and refine their conception of engineering design. Building on the results from a study of practicing engineers' conceptions of design, we present survey results from engineering students enrolled in Mechanical Engineering 110 (n=51), an upper-division human-centered design course. We compare the students' initial conceptions of design from before the course to those after the course. In particular, we look at how the course affects their perceived importance of specific design skills, and their level of agreement with a series of statements on the nature of design. We also compare the students' conceptions of design after the course to those of practicing engineers from a previous study. The upper division engineering students showed a remarkable similarity to the results of the practicing engineers with a few notable exceptions. Our results show that after the class, more engineering students identified synthesis as among the more important skills, and brainstorming as among the less important skills than before the class. Although the upper division engineering students before the course agreed with the practicing engineers in the idea that design is solution-led, this perception changed after taking the human-centered design course which emphasizes the importance of user research in the design process.},

However, students at every educational level are challenged by an ever-growing amount of material to review and an ongoing imperative to master new material. We developed a method for efficient, systematic, personalized review that combines statistical techniques for inferring individual differences with a psychological theory of memory. The method was integrated into a semester-long middle-school foreign-language course via retrieval-practice software. Using a cumulative exam administered after the semester's end, we compared time-matched review strategies and found that personalized review yielded a 16.5{\%} boost in course retention over current educational practice (massed study) and a 10.0{\%} improvement over a one-size-fits-all strategy for spaced study.},

Sixteen undergraduates solved quadratic function–finding problems and provided concurrent verbal protocols. Three fundamental areas of inductive activity were identified: Data Gathering, Pattern Finding, and Hypothesis Generation. These activities are evident in three different strategies that they used to successfully find functions. In all three strategies, Pattern Finding played a critical role not previously identified in the literature. In the most common strategy, called the Pursuit strategy, participants created new quantities from x and y, detected patterns in these quantities, and expressed these patterns in terms of x. These expressions were then built into full hypotheses. The processes involved in this strategy are instantiated in an ACT-based model that simulates both successful and unsuccessful performance. The protocols and the model suggest that numerical knowledge is essential to the detection of patterns and, therefore, to higher-order problem solving. One},

We present a social cognitive model of writing composed of three fundamental forms of self-regulation: environmental, behavioral, and covert or personal. Each of these triadic forms of self-regulation interact reciprocally via a cyclic feedback loop through which writers self-monitor and self-react to feedback about the effectiveness of specific self-regulatory techniques or pro-cesses. Well known writers' personal descriptions of ten major self-regulatory tech-niques are recounted, and empirical studies demonstrating the effectiveness of these self-regulatory techniques are discussed. We conclude that writing self-regulation is a complex system of interdependent processes that are closely linked to an underlying sense of self-efficacy, and we discuss implications of the proposed model of self-regulatory processes and self-beliefs for guiding future research and developing innova-tive writing instruction. ᭧ 1997 Academic Press During this era of cyberspace and microcomputers, skill in developing ideas and expressing them in written form has become essential to success in not only school but also in the personal and professional world beyond.

These target the complementary goals of enhancing both motivation and cognitive processing. Motivation can be increased by fostering students' beliefs that intellectual capacity is malleable and can be improved through effort and use of effective learning strategies. Cognitive processing can be enhanced by augmenting online videos and exercises with questions and prompts for students to generate explanations: before, during, and after learning. These instructional strategies provide students with direction while allowing them to take charge of their learning, are technically easy to implement, and are applicable to online resources across a wide range of topics.},

abstract = {Problem-based approaches to learning have a long history of advocating experience-based education. Psychological research and theory suggests that by having students learn through the experience of solving problems, they can learn both content and thinking strategies. Problem-based learning (PBL) is an instructional method in which students learn through facilitated problem solving. In PBL, student learning centers on a complex problem that does not have a single correct answer. Students work in collaborative groups to identify what they need to learn in order to solve a problem. They engage in self-directed learning (SDL) and then apply their new knowledge to the problem and reflect on what they learned and the effectiveness of the strategies employed. The teacher acts to facilitate the learning process rather than to provide knowledge. The goals of PBL include helping students develop 1) flexible knowledge, 2) effective problem-solving skills, 3) SDL skills, 4) effective collaboration skills, and 5) intrinsic motivation. This article discusses the nature of learning in PBL and examines the empirical evidence supporting it. There is considerable research on the first 3 goals of PBL but little on the last 2. Moreover, minimal research has been conducted outside medical and gifted education. Understanding how these goals are achieved with less skilled learners is an important part of a research agenda for PBL. The evidence suggests that PBL is an instructional approach that offers the potential to help students develop flexible understanding and lifelong learning skills.},

@article{Morrison2014,
abstract = {A student's capacity to learn a concept is directly related to how much cognitive load is used to comprehend the material. The central problem identified by Cognitive Load Theory is that learning is impaired when the total amount of processing requirements exceeds the limited capacity of working memory. Instruction can impose three different types of cognitive load on a student's working memory: intrinsic load, extraneous load, and germane load. Since working memory is a fixed size, instructional material should be designed to minimize the extraneous and intrinsic loads in order to increase the amount of memory available for the germane load. This will improve learning. To effectively design instruction to minimize cognitive load we must be able to measure the specific load components for any pedagogical intervention. This paper reports on a study that adapts a previously developed instrument to measure cognitive load. We report on the adaptation of the instrument to a new discipline, introductory computer science, and the results of measuring the cognitive load factors of specific lectures. We discuss the implications for the ability to measure specific cognitive load components and use of the tool in future studies.},

abstract = {This article aims to review literature on feedback to teachers. Because research has hardly focused on feedback among teachers, the review's scope also includes feedback in classrooms. The review proposes that the effectiveness of feedback and feedback processes depend on the learning theory adhered to. Findings show that regardless of the learning theory effective feedback is goal- or task-directed, specific, and neutral. In addition, four rules of thumb were formulated that reflect what a majority of learning theories suggested as effective for learning. Finally, some feedback characteristics were considered effective from only one learning theory. The article shows that feedback processes are complicated and many variables influence and mediate the processes. Most reviewed studies did not investigate the whole feedback processes, and therefore, we suggest that future research is needed to further understand feedback. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Across 2 studies of primarily Caucasian college students (ns = 209 and 268, respectively). the results of simultaneous multiple regression analyses demonstrated that avoidance factors predict negative attitudes toward counseling as well as decreased intentions to seek counseling. Overall, results demonstrate that avoidance factors account for at least as much help-seeking variance as traditionally studied approach factors.

abstract = {This paper focuses on peer feedback in relation to assessment processes. It examines the rationale for peer feedback, emphasising its potential for enhanced student learning. We draw on relevant literature to argue that the dominance of peer assessment processes using grades can undermine the potential of peer feedback for improving student learning. The paper throws further light on the issue by drawing on a large-scale questionnaire survey of tertiary students (1,740) and academics (460) in Hong Kong, supplemented by interview data. The findings indicate that a significant number of academics and students resist peer assessment using grades and that the majority report that students never or rarely grade each other in assessment activities. This paper explores why there is resistance, in particular, by academics to peer assessment and argues the case for a peer feedback process as an end in itself or as a precursor to peer assessment involving the awarding of marks. It also recommends some strategies for promoting peer feedback, through engaging students with criteria and for embedding peer involvement within normal course processes.},

abstract = {Many foundational learning tasks are uninteresting to learners. This paper proposes that when it is difficult to make a learning task interesting it can be effective to make it meaningful by promoting a prosocial, beyond-the-self-oriented purpose for learning. When this is done, self- regulation may be increased. This general conclusion was supported in four studies with over 2,500 participants. Study 1 documented a correlation between a beyond-the-self purpose for learning and both trait and behavioral measures of academic self-regulation. On average this correlation was stronger than the relation between the same measures of self-regulation and more self-oriented, intrinsic interest-driven motives. Next, Study 2 showed that a brief, one-time psychological intervention promoting a beyond-the-self purpose for learning could improve overall high school GPA at the end of the semester. Studies 3 and 4 explored psychological mechanisms, showing that the beyond-the-self purpose could sustain self-regulatory behavior over the course of an increasingly-boring task (Study 3) and raise level of construal (Study 4), while an analogous experimental manipulation promoting more self-oriented, intrinsic-interest motives for learning did not exhibit these effects. Implications for theories of motivation, self- regulation, psychological abstraction, and educational intervention are discussed.},

Forty-four first- and second-year undergraduate students participated in the study. Students kept blogs each week throughout a whole semester. Two journals were sampled at the beginning and end of the semester for each student. A repeated measure one-way ANOVA suggested that students' reflective thinking level increased significantly over time; however, peer feedback was found to negatively affect students' reflective thinking skills.

This observation suggests that research uncovering aspects of the human semantic, perceptual, and motor systems that inhibit the noticing of obscure features would enable researchers to identify effective techniques to overcome those obstacles. As a critical step in this research program, this study showed that the generic-parts technique can help people unearth the types of obscure features that can be used to overcome functional fixedness, which is a classic inhibitor to problem solving. Subjects trained on this technique solved on average 67{\%} more problems than a control group did. By devising techniques that facilitate the noticing of obscure features in order to overcome impediments to problem solving (e.g., design fixation), researchers can systematically create a tool kit of innovation-enhancing techniques.},

Half the children were told a noun label for each character (e.g., “She is a carrot-eater”), whereas half heard a verbal predicate (e.g., “She eats carrots whenever she can”). The children judged characteristics as significantly more stable over time and over contexts when the characteristics were referred to by a noun than when they were referred to by a verbal predicate.

abstract = {Recent randomized experiments have found that seemingly “small” social- psychological interventions in education—that is, brief exercises that target students' thoughts, feelings, and beliefs in and about school—can lead to large gains in student achievement and sharply reduce achievement gaps even months and years later. These interventions do not teach students aca- demic content but instead target students' psychology, such as their beliefs that they have the potential to improve their intelligence or that they belong and are valued in school. When social-psychological interventions have last- ing effects, it can seem surprising and even “magical,” leading people either to think of them as quick fixes to complicated problems or to consider them unworthy of serious consideration. The present article discourages both responses. It reviews the theoretical basis of several prominent social-psy- chological interventions and emphasizes that they have lasting effects because they target students' subjective experiences in school, because they use persuasive yet stealthy methods for conveying psychological ideas, and because they tap into recursive processes present in educational environ- ments. By understanding psychological interventions as powerful but con- text-dependent tools, educational researchers will be better equipped to take them to scale.

abstract = {Most contemporary achievement goal conceptualizations consist of a performance goal versus mastery goal dichotomy. The present research offers an alternative framework by partitioning the performance goal orientation into independent approach and avoidance motivational orientations. Two experiments investigated the predictive utility of the proposed approach-avoidance achievement goal conceptualization in the intrinsic motivation domain. Results from both experiments supported the proposed framework; only performance goals grounded in the avoidance of failure undermined intrinsic motivation. Task involvement was validated as a mediator of the observed effects on intrinsic motivation. Ramifications for the achievement goal approach to achievement motivation and future research avenues are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

abstract = {Electronic response systems (ERS) are a means to foster class participation by students who are reluctant to participate in class. In this study, we identify individual characteristics that relate to students' preference for anonymous classroom participation, and we also examine the extent to which preference for anonymity is related to their reactions to ERS. We find that extraversion is negatively related and both performance-avoid orientation and power distance orientation are positively related to preference for anonymity. Preference for anonymity is in turn positively related to both the attitude toward ERS and the perceived usefulness of ERS. These results are of importance to instructors interested in identifying instructional approaches that promote the participation of diverse students by providing opportunities for anonymous participation in the classroom.},

abstract = {Evaluation is an inescapable feature of academic life with regular grading and performance appraisals at school and at university. Although previous research has indicated that evaluation and grading in particular are likely to have a substantial impact on motivational processes, little attention has been paid to the relationship between grading and approach versus avoidance achievement goals, 2 fundamental concerns whenever evaluation is at stake. Three experiments, carried out in professional schools, revealed that expectation of a grade for a task, compared with no grade, consistently induced greater adoption of performance-avoidance, but not performance-approach, goals. Experiments 2 and 3 revealed that expectation of a grade, compared with no grade, consistently induced greater adoption of performance-avoidance goals even when grading was accompanied by a formative comment. Furthermore, Experiment 3 showed that reduced autonomous motivation measured after having completed a task for a grade versus no grade mediated the relationship between grading and adoption of performance-avoidance goals in a subsequent task. Results are discussed in the light of achievement goal and self-determination theory. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2011 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

This paper aims to offer such a rationale, within a framework which can also unify the diverse set of practices which have been described as formative. The analysis is used to relate formative assessment both to other pedagogic initiatives, notably cognitive acceleration and dynamic assessment, and to some of the existing literature on models of self-regulated learning and on classroom discourse. This framework should indicate potentially fruitful lines for further enquiry, whilst at the same time opening up new ways of helping teachers to implement formative practices more effectively.},

We present CrowdCrit, a web- based system that allows designers to receive design critiques from non-expert crowd workers. We evaluated CrowdCrit in three studies focusing on the designer's experience and bene- fits of the critiques. In the first study, we compared crowd and expert critiques and found evidence that aggregated crowd critique approaches expert critique. In a second study, we found that designers who got crowd feedback perceived that it improved their design process. The third study showed that designers were enthusiastic about crowd critiques and used them to change their designs. We conclude with implications for the design of crowd feedback services. Author},

abstract = {Since the beginning of the century, feedback interventions (FIs) produced negative--but largely ignored--effects on performance. A meta-analysis (607 effect sizes; 23,663 observations) suggests that FIs improved performance on average ( d = .41) but that over one-third of the FIs decreased performance. This finding cannot be explained by sampling error, feedback sign, or existing theories. The authors proposed a preliminary FI theory (FIT) and tested it with moderator analyses. The central assumption of FIT is that FIs change the locus of attention among 3 general and hierarchically organized levels of control: task learning, task motivation, and meta-tasks (including self-related) processes. The results suggest that FI effectiveness decreases as attention moves up the hierarchy closer to the self and away from the task. These findings are further moderated by task characteristics that are still poorly understood. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

The importance of this role is argued particularly in relation to learning with understanding (deep learning). It is pointed out that the requirements of assessment for formative and summative purposes differ in several dimensions, including reliability, the reference base of judgements and the focus of the information used. This challenges the assumption that summative judgements can be formed by simple summation of formative ones. An alternative procedure for linking formative and summative assessment is proposed such that their separate functions are preserved},

abstract = {Feedback is one of the most powerful influences on learning and achievement, but this impact can be either positive or negative. Its power is frequently mentioned in articles about learning and teaching, but surprisingly few recent studies have systematically investigated its meaning. This article provides a conceptual analysis of feedback and reviews the evidence related to its impact on learning and achievement. This evidence shows that although feedback is among the major influences, the type of feedback and the way it is given can be differentially effective. A model of feedback is then proposed that identifies the particular properties and circumstances that make it effective, and some typically thorny issues are discussed, including the timing of feedback and the effects of positive and negative feedback. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest ways in which feedback can be used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms.

The hint system displays, upon request from a student, a series of hints on how to approach a solution. The hints are created in advance from the source code of the exercise's reference solution using our hint generation tool. This tool can run in fully automatic mode, where hints reveal more and more parts of the solution code; in manual mode, where teachers can customize hints by annotating the input source code; and in a combination of the two modes. We evaluated the hint system throughout our Introduction to Programming course which provides a companion online course. The findings suggest that students who needed assistance with an exercise used the hint system and found it helpful to guide them through the process of building a solution.},

This paper illustrates various algorithmic techniques and user interaction models by describing inductive synthesizers for varied applications including synthesis of tricky bitvector algorithms, spreadsheetmacros for automating repetitive data manipulation tasks, ruler/compass based geometry constructions, new algebra problems, sequences for mathematical intellisense, and grading of programming problems.},

abstract = {Providing feedback on programming assignments manually is a tedious, error prone, and time-consuming task. In this paper, we motivate and address the problem of generating feedback on performance aspects in introductory programming assignments. We studied a large number of functionally correct student solutions to introductory programming assignments and observed: (1) There are different algorithmic strategies, with varying levels of efficiency, for solving a given problem. These different strategies merit different feedback. (2) The same algorithmic strategy can be implemented in countless different ways, which are not relevant for reporting feedback on the student program. We propose a light-weight programming language extension that allows a teacher to define an algorithmic strategy by specifying certain key values that should occur during the execution of an implementation. We describe a dynamic analysis based approach to test whether a student{\&}{\#}039;s program matches a teacher{\&}{\#}039;s specification. Our experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of both our specification language and our dynamic analysis. On one of our benchmarks consisting of 2316 functionally correct implementations to 3 programming problems, we identified 16 strategies that we were able to describe using our specification language (in 95 minutes after inspecting 66, i.e., around 3{\%}, implementations). Our dynamic analysis correctly matched each implementation with its corresponding specification, thereby automatically producing the intended feedback. },

abstract = {In recent years, e-learning platforms and MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have gained great popularity, and the Computer Science area is not excluded from this trend. A challenge for MOOCs is providing effective exercises to the students, and this is even more important in applied disciplines such as programming. A major difficulty of this challenge is ensuring that students do not get stuck in solving the exercises, which eventually leads to giving up. This is one of the most significant drawbacks of MOOCs over more traditional forms of teaching, where teachers can provide direct guidance to students who lack the necessary idea for solving an exercise. We designed AutoTeach, an incremental hint system for programming ex- ercises. Given a complete solution of a programming exercise, AutoTeach can generate several stripped out versions of it, numbered by hint level, which ini- tially only contain the skeleton of the solution's code, and then, for higher hint levels, gradually reveal more parts of the code and/or hints on how to write it. Students who get stuck on an exercise can ask for a hint (one or multiple times) and receive versions of the code where more and more parts of the solution are revealed, until they are able to proceed on their own. This way we ensure that students who happen to lack the necessary idea for solving an exercise can receive the help they need, instead of immediately giving up.},

abstract = {Natural deduction, which is a method for establishing validity of propositional type arguments, helps develop important reasoning skills and is thus a key ingredient in a course on introductory logic. We present two core components, namely solution generation and practice problem generation, for enabling computer-aided education for this important subject domain. The key enabling technology is use of an offline-computed data-structure called Universal Proof Graph (UPG) that encodes all possible applications of inference rules over all small propositions abstracted using their bitvector-based truth-table representation. This allows an efficient forward search for solution generation. More interestingly, this allows generating fresh practice problems that have given solution characteristics by performing a backward search in UPG. We obtained around 300 natural deduction problems from various textbooks. Our solution generation procedure can solve many more problems than the traditional forward-chaining based procedure, while our problem generation procedure can efficiently generate several variants with desired characteristics.},

Given a candidate student solution (control program for the robot), our grader first checks whether the robot performs the task correctly under a representative set of environment conditions. If it does not, the grader automatically generates feedback hinting at possible errors in the program. The auto-grader is based on a novel notion of constrained parameterized tests based on signal temporal logic (STL) that capture symptoms pointing to success or causes of failure in traces obtained from a realistic simulator. We define and solve the problem of synthesizing constraints on a parameterized test such that it is consistent with a set of reference solutions with and without the desired symptom. The usefulness of our grader is demonstrated using a large data set obtained from an on-campus laboratory-based course at UC Berkeley.},

Such feedback is easy to compute but might not provide the student enough help. Our first contribution is a novel way to automatically compute alternative conceptual hints. Our second contribution is a rigorous evaluation of feedback with 377 students. We find that providing either counterexamples or hints is judged as helpful, increases student perseverance, and can improve problem completion time. However, both strategies have particular strengths and weaknesses. Since our feedback is completely automatic, it can be deployed at scale and integrated into existing massive open online courses.},

abstract = {One challenge in making online education more effective is to develop automatic grading software that can provide meaningful feedback. This paper provides a solution to automatic grading of the standard computation-theory problem that asks a student to construct a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) from the given description of its language. We focus on how to assign partial grades for incorrect answers. Each student's answer is compared to the correct DFA using a hybrid of three techniques devised to capture different classes of errors. First, in an attempt to catch syntactic mistakes, we compute the edit distance between the two DFA descriptions. Second, we consider the entropy of the symmetric difference of the languages of the two DFAs, and compute a score that estimates the fraction of the number of strings on which the student answer is wrong. Our third technique is aimed at capturing mistakes in reading of the problem description. For this purpose, we consider a description language MOSEL, which adds syntactic sugar to the classical Monadic Second Order Logic, and allows defining regular languages in a concise and natural way. We provide algorithms, along with optimizations, for transforming MOSEL descriptions into DFAs and vice-versa. These allow us to compute the syntactic edit distance of the incorrect answer from the correct one in terms of their logical representations. We report an experimental study that evaluates hundreds of answers submitted by (real) students by comparing grades/feedback computed by our tool with human graders. Our conclusion is that the tool is able to assign partial grades in a meaningful way, and should be preferred over the human graders for both scalability and consistency.},

Since the grade of an agent is a measure of their ability to grade correctly, the PeerRank method weights grades by the grades of the grading agent. The PeerRank method also provides an incentive for agents to grade correctly. As the grades of an agent depend on the grades of the grading agents, and as these grades themselves depend on the grades of other agents, we define the PeerRank method by a fixed point equation similar to the PageRank method for ranking web-pages. We identify some formal properties of the PeerRank method (for example, it satisfies axioms of unanimity, no dummy, no discrimination and symmetry), discuss some examples, compare with related work and evaluate the performance on some synthetic data. Our results show considerable promise, reducing the error in grade predictions by a factor of 2 or more in many cases over the natural baseline of averaging peer grades.},

abstract = {Peer assessment helps students reflect and exposes them to different ideas. It scales assessment and allows large online classes to use open-ended assignments. However, it requires students to spend significant time grading. How can we lower this grading burden while maintaining quality? This paper integrates peer and machine grading to preserve the robustness of peer assessment and lower grading burden. In the identify-verify pattern, a grading algorithm first predicts a student grade and estimates confidence, which is used to estimate the number of peer raters required. Peers then identify key features of the answer using a rubric. Finally, other peers verify whether these feature labels were accurately applied. This pattern adjusts the number of peers that evaluate an answer based on algorithmic confidence and peer agreement. We evaluated this pattern with 1370 students in a large, online design class. With only 54{\%} of the student grading time, the identify-verify pattern yields 80-90{\%} of the accuracy obtained by taking the median of three peer scores, and provides more detailed feedback. A second experiment found that verification dramatically improves accuracy with more raters, with a 20{\%} gain over the peer-median with four raters. However, verification also leads to lower initial trust in the grading system. The identify-verify pattern provides an example of how peer work and machine learning can combine to improve the learning experience.},

abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are attracting the attention of a huge number of students all around the world. These courses include different types of assignments in order to evaluate the student's knowledge. However, these assignments are designed to allow a straightforward automatic evaluation. But, in this way it is not possible to evaluate some skills that would require answering open-response questions. Peer-assessment (the students are asked to assess other assignments), is an effective method to overcome the impossibility of having staff graders for this task. Additionally, students gain a deeper knowledge about the subject of the assignments that they have to read critically. However, the grades given by student-graders must be filtered to avoid bias due to a lack of experience in assessment tasks. There are a number of approaches to do this. In this paper we present a factorization approach that in addition to the grades given by graders is able to incorporate a representation of the contents of the responses given by students using a Vector Space Model of the assignments. So we fill the gap between peer-assessment and content-based methods that use a shallow linguistic processing. The paper includes a report of the results obtained using this approach in a real world dataset collected in 3 universities of Spain, A Coru{\~{n}}a, Pablo de Olavide at Sevilla, and Oviedo at Gijón. The scores obtained by the method presented here were compared with those provided by the staff of these universities. We report a considerable improvement whenever we use the content-based approach. In any case, we conclude that there is no evidence that staff grading would have led to more accurate grading outcomes than the assessment produced by our models.},

Foremost among these challenges is the problem of accurately and efficiently evaluating learner work as the class size grows, which is directly related to the larger goal of providing quality, timely, and actionable formative feedback. Recently there has been a surge in interest in using peer grading methods coupled with machine learning to accurately and fairly evaluate learner work while alleviating the instructor bottleneck and grading overload. Prior work in peer grading almost exclusively focuses on numerically scored grades - either real-valued or ordinal. In this work, we consider the implications of peer ranking in which learners rank a small subset of peer work from strongest to weakest, and propose new types of computational analyses that can be applied to this ranking data. We adopt a Bayesian approach to the ranked peer grading problem and develop a novel model and method for utilizing ranked peer-grading data. We additionally develop a novel procedure for adaptively identifying which work should be ranked by particular peers in order to dynamically resolve ambiguity in the data and rapidly resolve a clearer picture of learner performance. We showcase our results on both synthetic and several real-world educational datasets. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 ACM.},

In this paper, we explore how users respond to this question and find that their responses are not quite straightforward after all. Using data from Amazon product reviews, we present evidence that users do not make absolute, independent voting decisions based on individual review quality alone. Rather, whether users vote at all, as well as the polarity of their vote for any given review, depends on the context in which they view it - reviews receive a larger overall number of votes when they are 'misranked', and the polarity of votes becomes more positive/negative when the review is ranked lower/higher than it deserves. We distill these empirical findings into a new probabilistic model of rating behavior that includes the dependence of rating decisions on context. Understanding and formally modeling voting behavior is crucial for designing learning mechanisms and algorithms for review ranking, and we conjecture that many of our findings also apply to user behavior in other online content-rating settings.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic model on permutations, which inherits the advantages of both the Luce model and the Mallows model and avoids their limitations. We refer to the model as coset-permutation distance based stagewise (CPS) model. Different from the Mallows model, the CPS model is a stagewise model. It decomposes the generative process of a permutation $\pi$ into sequential stages, which makes the efficient computation possible. At the k-th stage, an object is selected and assigned to position k with a certain probability. Different from the Luce model, the CPS model defines the selection probability based on the distance between a location permutation $\sigma$ and the right coset of $\pi$ (referred to as coset-permutation distance) at each stage. In this sense, it is also a distance-based model. Because many different permutation distances can be used to induce the coset-permutation distance, the CPS model also has rich expressiveness. Furthermore, the coset-permutation distances induced by many popular permutation distances can be computed with polynomial time complexity, which further ensures the efficiency of the CPS model.},

abstract = {MOOCs have been highly successful due to the ease of disseminating infor- mation: anyone with an Internet connection can watch videos of the lectures and download study material. However, they still lag far behind conven- tional classrooms in one critical aspect—feedback to and evaluation of the students—due to severe mismatches in the number of students enrolled and the number of experts available. One means of performing evaluation and feedback is peer evaluation wherein the answers submitted by a student are anonymized and provided to a set of other students to evaluate. As per cur- rent peer evaluation techniques, these peer evaluators assign cardinal scores to the given solutions. In this paper, we posit an alternative approach to peer evaluation based on pairwise comparisons.We argue that such an ordinal ap- proach is significantly more robust to the lack of expertise of the evaluators, as compared to the conventional cardinal approaches.},

abstract = {We investigate the potential of using ordinal peer grading for the evaluation of students in massive online open courses (MOOCs). According to such grading schemes, each student receives a few assignments (by other students) which she has to rank. Then, a global ranking (possibly translated into numerical scores) is produced by combining the individual ones. This is a novel application area for social choice concepts and methods where the important problem to be solved is as follows: how should the assignments be distributed so that the collected individual rankings can be easily merged into a global one that is as close as possible to the ranking that represents the relative performance of the students in the assignment? Our main theoretical result suggests that using very simple ways to distribute the assignments so that each student has to rank only k of them, a Borda-like aggregation method can recover a 1 - O(1/k) fraction of the true ranking when each student correctly ranks the assignments she receives. Experimental results strengthen our analysis further and also demonstrate that the same method is extremely robust even when students have imperfect capabilities as graders. Our results provide strong evidence that ordinal peer grading cam be a highly effective and scalable solution for evaluation in MOOCs.},

abstract = {Massive Online Open Courses have become an accessible and affordable choice for education. This has led to new technical challenges for instructors such as student evaluation at scale. Recent work has found ordinal peer grading, where individual grader orderings are aggregated into an overall ordering of assignments, to be a viable alternate to traditional instructor/staff evaluation [21]. Existing techniques, which extend rank-aggregation methods, produce a single ordering as output. However, a single ordering alone may not be sufficient for instructors to con- fidently determine the final grades. For instance, instructors would like to have an estimate of the uncertainty of each assignment's grade as well. In this work, we tackle this problem by applying Bayesian techniques to the ordinal peer grading problem; in particular we use MCMC-based sampling techniques in conjunction with the Mallows model. Experiments are performed on real-world peer grading datasets along with an analysis of the quality of the learned posterior distributions.},

In this paper, we study the problem of automatically grading the kinds of open response mathematical questions that figure prominently in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) courses. Our data-driven framework for mathematical language processing (MLP) leverages solution data from a large number of learners to evaluate the correctness of their solutions, assign partial-credit scores, and provide feedback to each learner on the likely locations of any errors. MLP takes inspiration from the success of natural language processing for text data and comprises three main steps. First, we convert each solution to an open response mathematical question into a series of numerical features. Second, we cluster the features from several solutions to uncover the structures of correct, partially correct, and incorrect solutions. We develop two different clustering approaches, one that leverages generic clustering algorithms and one based on Bayesian nonparametrics. Third, we automatically grade the remaining (potentially large number of) solutions based on their assigned cluster and one instructor-provided grade per cluster. As a bonus, we can track the cluster assignment of each step of a multistep solution and determine when it departs from a cluster of correct solutions, which enables us to indicate the likely locations of errors to learners. We test and validate MLP on real-world MOOC data to demonstrate how it can substantially reduce the human effort required in large-scale educational platforms.},

abstract = {—Over the past few years, the rapid emergence of massive open online courses (MOOCs) has sparked a great deal of research interest in MOOC data analytics. Dropout prediction, or identifying students at risk of dropping out of a course, is an important problem to study due to the high attrition rate commonly found on many MOOC platforms. The methods proposed recently for dropout prediction apply relatively simple machine learning methods like support vector machines and logistic regression, using features that reflect such student activities as lecture video watching and forum activities on a MOOC platform during the study period of a course. Since the features are captured continuously for each student over a period of time, dropout prediction is essentially a time series prediction problem. By regarding dropout prediction as a sequence classi-fication problem, we propose some temporal models for solving it. In particular, based on extensive experiments conducted on two MOOCs offered on Coursera and edX, a recurrent neural network (RNN) model with long short-term memory (LSTM) cells beats the baseline methods as well as our other proposed methods by a large margin.},

We introduce two structured labeling solutions, a novel technique we propose for helping people define and refine their concept in a consistent manner as they label. Through a series of five experiments, including a controlled lab study, we illustrate the impact and dynamics of concept evolution in practice and show that structured labeling helps people label more consistently in the presence of concept evolution than traditional labeling.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This paper explores the design space of data-driven interaction techniques for educational video navigation. We introduce a set of techniques that augment existing video interface widgets, including: a 2D video timeline with an embedded visualization of collective navigation traces; dynamic and non-linear timeline scrubbing; data-enhanced transcript search and keyword summary; automatic display of relevant still frames next to the video; and a visual summary representing points with high learner activity. To evaluate the feasibility of the techniques, we ran a laboratory user study with simulated learning tasks. Participants rated watching lecture videos with interaction data to be efficient and useful in completing the tasks. However, no significant differences were found in task performance, suggesting that interaction data may not always align with moment-by-moment information needs during the tasks.},

The algorithms are more accurate than current state-of-the-art methods at recreating expert suggestions, are easy to implement and scale well.

A learner's behavior such as if a learner will drop out from the course can be predicted. How to provide an effective, economical, and scalable method to detect cheating on tests such as surrogate exam-taker is a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a grade predicting method that uses student activity features to predict whether a learner may get a certification if he/she takes a test. The method consists of two-step classifications: motivation classification (MC) and grade classification (GC). The MC divides all learners into three groups including certification earning, video watching, and course sampling. The GC then predicts a certification earning learner may or may not obtain a certification. Our experiment shows that the proposed method can fit the classification model at a fine scale and it is possible to find a surrogate exam-taker.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Peer reviews of conference paper submissions is an in- tegral part of the research cycle, though it has unknown origins. For the computer vision community, this process has become significantly more difficult in recent years due to the volume of submissions. For example, the number of submissions to the CVPR conference has tripled in the last ten years. For this reason, the community has been forced to reach out to a less than ideal pool of reviewers, which un- fortunately includes uninformed junior graduate students, disgruntled senior graduate students, and tenured faculty. In this work we take the simple intuition that the quality of a paper can be estimated by merely glancing through the general layout, and use this intuition to build a system that employs basic computer vision techniques to predict if the paper should be accepted or rejected. This system can then be used as a first cascade layer during the review pro- cess. Our results show that while rejecting 15{\%} of good papers, we can cut down the number of bad papers by more than 50{\%}, saving valuable time of reviewers. Finally, we fed this very paper into our system and are happy to report that it received a posterior probability of 88.4{\%} of being good. 1.

Using this tool, teachers and students can write Python programs directly in the web browser (without installing any plugins), step forwards and backwards through execution to view the run-time state of data structures, and share their program visualizations on the web. In the past three years, over 200,000 people have used Online Python Tutor to visualize their programs. In addition, instructors in a dozen universities such as UC Berkeley, MIT, the University of Washington, and the University of Waterloo have used it in their CS1 courses. Finally, Online Python Tutor visualizations have been embedded within three webbased digital Python textbook projects, which collectively attract around 16,000 viewers per month and are being used in at least 25 universities. Online Python Tutor is free and open source software, available at pythontutor.com. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

abstract = {As a step towards scaling personalized instruction, we seek to automatically identify the key features of the interactive learning process teachers use to select the next activity when teaching a single student. Such features could both inform computational student models designed to facilitate instructional decisions, and help enable automated self-improving teaching systems that leverage this identified feature set. We present preliminary results that a very small set of features is almost as good as a much larger set of features at predicting human tutor decisions when teaching students about histograms.},

abstract = {One problem that arises with the increasing numbers of stu- dents in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is that of student evaluation. The large number of students makes it infeasible for the instructors or the teaching assistants to grade all assignments, while the present auto-grading tech- nology is not feasible for many topics of interest. As a result, there has recently been a great push for employing peer- grading, where students grade each other, since the number of graders automatically scale with the number of students. However, in practice, peer-grading has been observed to have high error rates and has come under serious criticism. In this paper, we take a statistical approach towards un- derstanding the feasibility of peer-grading for MOOCs. Un- der simple (yet general) models, we show that peer-grading as a standalone will not scale, i.e., as the number of stu- dents increases, the expected number of students misgraded will grow proportionately. We then consider a hybrid ap- proach that combines peer-grading with auto-grading. In this setting, an automated approach is used for ‘dimension- ality reduction', a classical technique in statistics and ma- chine learning, and peer-grading is employed to evaluate this lower dimensional set of answers. We show that this alter- native approach has the potential to scale. While most current research on assessment in MOOCs is empirical, our more theoretical approach provides a funda- mental understanding of the errors observed in current grad- ing systems, and provides a direction for future research to overcome those errors.},

abstract = {Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) is an acute phase reactant produced by a variety of cell types at sites of local inflammation. We examined by immunohistochemistry renal biopsies from patients with acute rejection (n = 10), protocol biopsies without rejection (n = 37), and peri-operative donor biopsies of the same transplant patients (n = 94) for intra-renal expression of PTX3, and its correlation with clinical, laboratory, and histopathologic parameters. PTX3 was mainly expressed in the interstitium of renal allograft. In the non-rejection biopsies (pre- and post-reperfusion and protocol biopsies), PTX3 expression area (PTX3{\%}) was equally maintained at a low level, whereas in the rejection biopsies, PTX3{\%} was significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.0001). Treatment of acute rejection resulted in a significant reduction of PTX3{\%} (p {\textless} 0.0001). PTX3{\%} positively correlated with the degree of allograft dysfunction and acute rejection scores of Banff classification (2009). This study suggests that PTX3{\%} may be an available histological marker of acute renal allograft rejection.},

abstract = {The aim of this report is to examine what--if any--effects the introduction of the European Directive 98/79/EC has had on the performance of in-vitro diagnostic devices (kits) used in determining hormones and related measurands in medical diagnostic laboratories. The observations covered the period from 1993-2008, results being taken from EQA surveys at three year intervals. The measurands chosen were: cortisol, progesterone, testosterone, 17beta oestradiol (E2), free triiodothyronine (fT3), total triiodothyronine (TT3), free thyroxine (fT4), total thyroxine (TT4), thyrotropin (TSH), luteotropin (LH), follitropin (FSH), prolactin (PRL), parathyrin (PTH), thyroglobulin (Tg), anti-thyroid microsomes (MAb), anti-thyroid peroxidase (Anti-TPO), anti-thyroglobulin (Anti-Tg) and anti-TSH-receptor (TRAb). The results showed the following trends and tendencies: a. The precision has improved over the observation period, mainly due to automation made possible by the use of non-radioisotopic labelling. b. The accuracy--in terms of comparison with reference method values--has not been influenced by the Directive 98/79/EC. c. Introduction of international standards and reference preparations does not itself result in better comparison of results between kits from different manufacturers. d. Harmonisation in methodology has led to improved comparison between different manufacturers--an example being the assay of thyroid-receptor antibodies, where components are often only available from one producer.},

abstract = {The automatic evaluation of computer programs is a nascent area of research with a potential for large-scale impact. Extant program assessment systems score mostly based on the number of test-cases passed, providing no insight into the competency of the programmer. In this paper, we present a system to grade computer programs automatically. In addition to grading a program on its programming practices and complexity, the key kernel of the system is a machine-learning based algorithm which determines closeness of the logic of the given program to a correct program. This algorithm uses a set of highly-informative features, derived from the abstract representations of a given program, that capture the program's functionality. These features are then used to learn a model to grade the programs, which are built against evaluations done by experts. We show that the regression models provide much better grading than the ubiquitous test-case-pass based grading and rivals the grading accuracy of other open-response problems such as essay grading. We also show that our novel features add significant value over and above basic keyword/expression count features. In addition to this, we propose a novel way of posing computer-program grading as a one-class modeling problem and report encouraging preliminary results. We show the value of the system through a case study in a real-world industrial deployment. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first time a system using machine learning has been developed and used for grading programs. The work is timely with regard to the recent boom in Massively Online Open Courseware (MOOCs), which promises to produce a significant amount of hand-graded digitized data.},

abstract = {People have strong intuitions about the masses of objects and the causal forces that they exert upon one another. These intuitions have been explored through a variety of tasks, in particular judging the relative masses of objects involved in collisions and evaluating whether one object caused another to move. We present a single framework for explaining two types of judgments that people make about the dynamics of objects, based on Bayesian inference. In this framework, we define a particular model of dynamics essentially Newtonian physics plus Gaussian noise which makes predictions about the trajectories of objects following collisions based on their masses. By applying Bayesian inference, it becomes possible to reason from trajectories back to masses, and to reason about whether one object caused another to move. We use this framework to predict human causality judgments using data collected from a mass judgment task.},

We created a user interface that addresses feed- back at scale for a particular and important aspect of code quality: variable names. We built this user interface on top of an existing back-end that distinguishes variables by their behavior in the program. Therefore our interface not only allows teachers to comment on poor variable names, they can comment on names that mislead the reader about the variable's role in the program. We ran two user studies in which 10 teachers and 6 students created and received feed- back, respectively. The interface helped teachers give person- alized variable name feedback on thousands of student so- lutions from an edX introductory programming MOOC. In the second study, students composed solutions to the same programming assignments and immediately received person- alized quizzes composed by teachers in the previous user study.},

abstract = {This study compared the results from nine automated essay scoring engines on eight essay scoring prompts drawn from six states that annually administer high-stakes writing assessments. Student essays from each state were randomly divided into three sets: a training set (used for modeling the essay prompt responses and consisting of text and ratings from two human raters along with a final or resolved score), a second test set used for a blind test of the vendor-developed model (consisting of text responses only), and a validation set that was not employed in this study. The essays encompassed writing assessment items from three grade levels (7, 8, 10) and were evenly divided between source-based prompts (i.e., essay prompts developed on the basis of provided source material) or those drawn from traditional writing genre (i.e., narrative, descriptive, persuasive). The total sample size was N = 22,029. Six of the eight essays were transcribed from their original handwritten responses using two transcription vendors. Transcription accuracy rates were computed at 98.70{\%} for 17,502 essays. The remaining essays were typed in by students during the actual assessment and provided in ASCII form. Seven of the eight essays were holistically scored and one employed score assignments for two traits. Scale ranges, rubrics, and scoring adjudications for the essay sets were quite variable. Results were presented on distributional properties of the data (mean and standard deviation) along with traditional measures used in automated essay scoring: exact agreement, exact+adjacent agreement, kappa, quadratic-weighted kappa, and the Pearson r. The results demonstrated that overall, automated essay scoring was capable of producing scores similar to human scores for extended-response writing items with equal performance for both source-based and traditional writing genre. Because this study incorporated already existing data (and the limitations associated with them), it is highly likely that the estimates provided represent a floor for what automated essay scoring can do under operational conditions.},

The basic design consisted of two conditions of instructional support (text and questions vs. questions only), two testings (immediate vs. retention), five levels of simi- larity between lesson and posttest questions, and five feedback conditions: knowledge of correct response (KCR), delayed KCR, answer until correct (AUC), questions only (no feedback), and no questions. Results showed significant benefits for feedback over no feedback, with A UC becoming more advan- tageous and delayed feedback less so as lesson-posttest question similarity decreased. Also, with decreased question similarity and the availability of supporting text, overall feedback effects tended to decrease. The results are discussed in terms of the information processing effects of the different feedback forms, a factor that CBI designers often fail to exploit in planning feedback conditions. This},

Cognitive knowledge assessed by MCQ predicts and correlates well with overall competence and performance but examinees and examiners alike frequently perceive MCQ-based testing as 'unfair'. Fairness is akin to defensibility and is an increasingly important concept in testing. It is dependent on psychometric adequacy, diligence of construction, attention to consequential validity and appropriate standard setting. There is a wealth of evidence that extended matching questions are the fairest format but MCQs should always be combined with practical assessments, as written testing emphasizes learning from written sources.},

abstract = {Increasingly, associated with assessment in large classes, arising from a combination academics are confronted with issues of factors including higher student enrolments and the introduction of a trimester of study in many universities. The resulting increased time pressures on marking are causing many academics to search for alternative forms of assessment. University teachers are making more frequent use of multiple choice questions as a matter of expediency and in some cases, the quality of the assessment is being neglected. This describes the current situation in Information Technology. The aim of this paper is to provide practical guidelines in the form of a checklist for lecturers who wish to write tests containing multiple choice questions. Some of the points raised may be considered common knowledge for those teachers with a background in Education, however not all Information Technology lecturers would fall into this category. While the intended users of the checklist are Information Technology lecturers who, in general, are unlikely to be familiar with many of the matters discussed, teachers in other disciplines may find it a useful reference. addition to the checklist, this paper also discusses the major criticism of multiple choice questions (that they do not test anything more than just straight recall of facts) and examines ways of overcoming this misconce},

The advantage of retrieval practice generalized across texts identical to those commonly found in science education. The advantage of retrieval practice was observed with test questions that assessed comprehension and required students to make inferences. The advantage of retrieval practice occurred even when the criterial test involved creating concept maps. Our findings support the theory that retrieval practice enhances learning by retrieval-specific mechanisms rather than by elaborative study processes. Retrieval practice is an effective tool to promote conceptual learning about science.},

@article{Little2015,
abstract = {Answering multiple-choice questions with competitive alternatives can enhance performance on a later test, not only on questions about the information previously tested, but also on questions about related information not previously tested-in particular, on questions about information pertaining to the previously incorrect alternatives. In the present research, we assessed a possible explanation for this pattern: When multiple-choice questions contain competitive incorrect alternatives, test-takers are led to retrieve previously studied information pertaining to all of the alternatives in order to discriminate among them and select an answer, with such processing strengthening later access to information associated with both the correct and incorrect alternatives. Supporting this hypothesis, we found enhanced performance on a later cued-recall test for previously nontested questions when their answers had previously appeared as competitive incorrect alternatives in the initial multiple-choice test, but not when they had previously appeared as noncompetitive alternatives. Importantly, however, competitive alternatives were not more likely than noncompetitive alternatives to be intruded as incorrect responses, indicating that a general increased accessibility for previously presented incorrect alternatives could not be the explanation for these results. The present findings, replicated across two experiments (one in which corrective feedback was provided during the initial multiple-choice testing, and one in which it was not), thus strongly suggest that competitive multiple-choice questions can trigger beneficial retrieval processes for both tested and related information, and the results have implications for the effective use of multiple-choice tests as tools for learning.},

@article{Attali2003,
abstract = {In this article, the authors show that test makers and test takers have a strong and systematic tendency for hiding correct answers-or, respectively, for seeking them-in middle positions. In single, isolated questions, both prefer middle positions to extreme ones in a ratio of up to 3 or 4 to 1. Because test makers routinely, deliberately, and excessively balance the answer key of operational tests, middle bias almost, though not quite, disappears in those keys. Examinees taking real tests also produce answer sequences that are more balanced than their single question tendencies but less balanced than the correct key. In a typical four-choice test, about 55{\%} of erroneous answers are in the two central positions. The authors show that this bias is large enough to have real psychometric consequences, as questions with middle correct answers are easier and less discriminating than questions with extreme correct answers, a fact of which some implications are explored.},

This article reports our experiences with two iterations of the first large online class to use peer and selfassessment. In this class, peer grades correlated highly with staff-assigned grades. The second iteration had 42.9{\%} of students' grades within 5{\%} of the staff grade, and 65.5{\%} within 10{\%}. On average, students assessed their work 7{\%} higher than staff did. Students also rated peers' work from their own country 3.6{\%} higher than those from elsewhere. We performed three experiments to improve grading accuracy. We found that giving students feedback about their grading bias increased subsequent accuracy. We introduce short, customizable feedback snippets that cover common issues with assignments, providing students more qualitative peer feedback. Finally, we introduce a data-driven approach that highlights high-variance items for improvement. We find that rubrics that use a parallel sentence structure, unambiguous wording, and well-specified dimensions have lower variance. After revising rubrics, median grading error decreased from 12.4{\%} to 9.9{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM 1073-0516/2013/12-ART33.},

abstract = {Over a period of 6 months, over 40 patients worldwide have built Artificial Pancreas Systems (APS) with off-label use of existing insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitors (CGM), and open source software (OpenAPS). The patients have been using these systems outside of any clinical trial setting for more than 80,000 total hours. OpenAPS is designed to be, and has been, far safer than standard pump/CGM therapy, as measured by duration of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, with no reports of severe hypo or hyperglycemic events. It has allowed patients and caregivers remarkable improvements in quality of life due to increased time in range, uninterrupted sleep, and peace of mind. OpenAPS users (18 respondents, 67{\%} male / 33{\%} female, 61{\%} adults / 39{\%} children, median 27 years old (SD 14.5 years), 15 years with diabetes (SD 11.7 years), 10 years on pump therapy (SD 3.6 years), 3 years on CGM (SD 2.5 years)) were surveyed on quantitative and qualitative measures of their experience using their self-built APS. While using OpenAPS, self-reported outcome measures showed median HbA1c dropped from 7.1{\%} (SD 0.8{\%}) to 6.2{\%} (SD 0.5{\%}), and median percent time in range (80-180 mg/dL) increased from 58{\%} (SD 14{\%}) to 81{\%} (SD 8{\%}). All but one respondent reported some improvement in sleep quality, and 56{\%} reported a large improvement. Users cautioned that DIY AP implementations require significant effort to build and maintain, and pointed out that these systems cannot be considered a “technological cure,” but were extremely satisfied with the “life changing” improvements associated with using an APS. Many users reported their health care providers (HCP) as being supportive, but some expressed disappointment at lack of interest from their HCP. These experiences are instructive for what patients can expect from commercial APS when they become available, and can help HCPs be prepared to set patients' expectations properly when discussing or recommending an APS.},

This paper investigated the influence of interruptions on different types of decision-making tasks and the ability of information presentation formats, an aspect of information systems design, to alleviate them. Results from the experimental study indicate that interruptions facilitate performance on simple tasks, while inhibiting performance on more complex tasks. Interruptions also influenced the relationship between information presentation format and the type of task performed: spatial presentation formats were able to mitigate the effects of interruptions while symbolic formats were not. The paper presents a broad conceptualization of interruptions and interprets the ramifications of the experimental findings within this conceptualization to develop a program for future research.},

abstract = {Requests are at the core of many social media systems such as question {\&} answer sites and online philanthropy commu- nities. While the success of such requests is critical to the success of the community, the factors that lead community members to satisfy a request are largely unknown. Success of a request depends on factors like who is asking, how they are asking, when are they asking, and most critically what is being requested, ranging from small favors to substantial monetary donations.We present a case study of altruistic re- quests in an online community where all requests ask for the very same contribution and do not offer anything tangible in return, allowing us to disentangle what is requested from tex- tual and social factors. Drawing from social psychology liter- ature, we extract high-level social features from text that op- erationalize social relations between recipient and donor and demonstrate that these extracted relations are predictive of success. More specifically, we find that clearly communicat- ing need through the narrative is essential and that linguistic indications of gratitude, evidentiality, and generalized reci- procity, as well as high status of the asker further increase the likelihood of success. Building on this understanding, we de- velop a model that can predict the success of unseen requests, significantly improving over several baselines.We link these findings to research in psychology on helping behavior, pro- viding a basis for further analysis of success in social media systems.},

People reflect on this data using different tools for personal informatics. However, current tools do not have sufficient understanding of users' self-reflection needs to appropriately leverage Ubicomp technologies. To design tools that effectively assist self-reflection, we need to comprehensively understand what kinds of questions people have about their data, why they ask these questions, how they answer them with current tools, and what kinds of problems they encounter. To explore this, we conducted interviews with people who use various kinds of tools for personal informatics. We found six kinds of questions that people asked about their data. We also found that certain kinds of questions are more important at certain times, which we call phases. We identified two phases of reflection: Discovery and Maintenance. We discuss the kinds of questions and the phases in detail and identify features that should be supported in personal informatics tools for which Ubicomp technologies can play an important role.},

@book{Binkley2012,
abstract = {As the previous chapter indicates, there has been a significant shift in advanced economies from manufacturing to information and knowledge services. Knowledge itself is growing ever more specialized and expanding exponentially. Information and communication technology is transforming the nature of how work is conducted and the meaning of social relationships. Decentralized decision making, information sharing, teamwork, and innovation are key in today's enterprises. No longer can students look forward to middle class success in the conduct of manual labor or use of routine skills - work that can be accomplished by machines. Rather, whether a technician or a professional person, success lies in being able to communicate, share, and use information to solve complex problems, in being able to adapt and innovate in response to new demands and changing circumstances, in being able to marshal and expand the power of technology to create new knowledge, and in expanding human capacity and productivity. Research during the last decade has shown how new social practices evolve clue to increased use of new digital technologies, especially among young people (Buckingham and Willett 2006). Such practices create reconceptions of key competencies and skills, not defined from a systems level but from the everyday lives of people in our societies. One example is research done on computer games and online communities (Gee 2007), where problem solving is defined as a key component of such practices. Such experiences of problem solving among young people need to inform us in the way we design assessment tasks and define key competencies. Hence, new standards for what students should be able to do must replace the basic skills and knowledge expectations of the past. To meet this challenge, schools must be transformed in ways that will enable students to acquire the sophisticated thinking, flexible problem solving, and collaboration and communication skills they will need to be successful in work and life. New conceptions of educational standards and assessment, the subject of this chapter, are a key strategy for accomplishing the necessary transformation. Such standards and assessment can both focus attention on necessary capacities and provide data to leverage and evaluate system change. Technology too serves as both a driver and lever for the transformation. In the sections that follow, we synthesize research on the role of standards and assessment in promoting learning, describe the nature of assessment systems that can support changes in practice and use these to develop guiding principles for the design of next generation assessments, illustrate the use of technology to transform assessment systems and learning, and propose a MODEL for assessing twenty-first century skills. Our intent is to learn from the past as we prepare for new futures in educational standards and assessment. While we provide a list of twenty-first century skills based on our analysis of twelve relevant frameworks drawn from a number of countries, these serve as an example of how to think about assessing twenty-first century skills. We expect that educators, as they consider our model, may need to make adaptations that fit their own contexts as they design assessments appropriate for their schools and students. We have organized the ten skills we have identified into four groupings: Ways of Thinking 1. Creativity and innovation 2. Critical thinking, problem solving, decision making 3. Learning to learn, Metacognition Ways of Working 4. Communication 5. Collaboration (teamwork) Tools for Working 6. Information literacy 7. ICT literacy Living in the World 8.

abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) aim to educate the world. More often than not, however, MOOCs fall short of this goal — a majority of learners are already highly educated (with a Bachelor degree or more) and come from specific parts of the (developed) world. Learners from developing countries without a higher degree are underrepresented, though desired, in MOOCs. One reason for those learners to drop out of a course can be found in their financial realities and the subsequent limited amount of time they can dedicate to a course besides earning a living. If we could pay learners to take a MOOC, this hurdle would largely disappear. With MOOCS, this leads to the following fundamental challenge: How can learners be paid at scale? Ultimately, we envision a recommendation engine that recommends tasks from online market places such as Upwork or witmart to learners, that are relevant to the course content of the MOOC. In this manner, the learners learn and earn money. To investigate the feasibility of this vision, in this paper we explored to what extent (1) online market places contain tasks relevant to a specific MOOC, and (2) learners are able to solve real-world tasks correctly and with sufficient quality. Finally, based on our experimental design, we were also able to investigate the impact of real-world bonus tasks in a MOOC on the general learner population.},

At the same time it places no restrictions on the sequencing of the identification process. This approach is to make our solution attractive to both skilled amateurs and professionals.

abstract = {Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world's top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers - often implicitly - assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these "standard subjects" are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species - frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior - hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.},

abstract = {Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) is an acute phase reactant produced by a variety of cell types at sites of local inflammation. We examined by immunohistochemistry renal biopsies from patients with acute rejection (n = 10), protocol biopsies without rejection (n = 37), and peri-operative donor biopsies of the same transplant patients (n = 94) for intra-renal expression of PTX3, and its correlation with clinical, laboratory, and histopathologic parameters. PTX3 was mainly expressed in the interstitium of renal allograft. In the non-rejection biopsies (pre- and post-reperfusion and protocol biopsies), PTX3 expression area (PTX3{\%}) was equally maintained at a low level, whereas in the rejection biopsies, PTX3{\%} was significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.0001). Treatment of acute rejection resulted in a significant reduction of PTX3{\%} (p {\textless} 0.0001). PTX3{\%} positively correlated with the degree of allograft dysfunction and acute rejection scores of Banff classification (2009). This study suggests that PTX3{\%} may be an available histological marker of acute renal allograft rejection.},
