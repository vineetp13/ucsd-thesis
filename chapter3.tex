\section{Dual objective functions in learning and crowdsourcing}
Combining university classes in psychology with editing
Wikipedia articles led to improvement in the scientific
content of over 800 Wikipedia articles while students
learned about the topic they edited [25]. Similarly, Kim et
al. asked learners to create how-to video segments as part
of an online curriculum [35]; the student-created videos
then became a learning resource for the next cohort. 

Some crowdsourcing offers a dual objective: user-facing
goals include fun (e.g., Peekaboom [2]), authentication
(reCAPTCHA [3]), and learning (Duolingo [28]). Under the
hood, these tasks simultaneously label images, transcribe
text, and translate phrases. Such crowd work can also bootstrap machine learning [8]. This paper is distinct from prior
work (Figure 2) in leveraging peopleâ€™s individual lived
experience, knowledge, context, and folk theories, rather
than treating people as interchangeable respondents.

 experimentation is the gold standard

\section{Motivation}
3 reasons: people created novel hypo, people discuss on online fora, people can track fine-grained data, people are motivated to find answers
